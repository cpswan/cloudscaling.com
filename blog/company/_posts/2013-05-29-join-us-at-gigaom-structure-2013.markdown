[![125x125_structure_come-see-us](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/125x125_structure_come-see-us.png)](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/125x125_structure_come-see-us.png)Structure is a unique tech conference world: a venue where technical and business visionaries in cloud computing share candid observations about what works, what’s broken, and what picture they see in the industry’s crystal ball. Ideas are hatched, relationships are born, and plenty of quoteworthy lines are dropped. And no one ever leaves saying, “meh.”

Cloudscaling will be at Structure 2013, talking about [OCS 2.5](http://cloudscaling.com/products/ocs-system-overview/) and use cases like hybrid cloud, dev/test, platform-as-a-service, scale-out web apps and big data. We’ll also have an update on our [partnership with Juniper](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/juniper/), in which we’re bringing Contrail technology to OCS. Our recent [Series B financing](http://www.eweek.com/cloud/juniper-seagate-invest-in-cloud-platform-startup-cloudscaling/) and our [latest batch of customers](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ubisoft-chooses-cloudscaling-open-cloud-system/) will also be on the agenda.
