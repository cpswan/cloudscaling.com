# Your Journey to a Hybrid Cloud

At Cloudscaling, we believe that the hybrid cloud is the future of all cloud computing and will allow organizations to find the best solution for running workloads in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

The hybrid model allows you to blend the best of the public cloud with private cloud into one common architecture. Private clouds are normally for critical applications that use sensitive data or legacy applications that can’t easily be reengineered for the cloud. Public clouds are for less important or temporary applications. A hybrid cloud ties the two together and allows workloads to move with minimal  friction between the two environments as computing demands change. The hybrid cloud provides the best possible combination of cost-efficiency, security, reliability, performance and control.

Many organizations run on the public cloud first as a way to get computing capacity in real-time with a utility pricing model, but as utilization rises, costs catch up and many I/O intensive applications like databases and Big Data platforms are too complex to manage on a public cloud-only infrastructure. As organizations continue their cloud journey, these limitations are what drive CIOs to consider alternatives like OpenStack to create a hybrid environment.

The benefits of an open hybrid cloud go beyond security, cost savings and the freedom to run applications where you want. When end users can access compute capacity quickly and easily from their own IT organization, the incentive for using public cloud services is reduced, allowing businesses to quickly regain control of IT spending and more strategically manage their technology deployments. Ultimately CIOs want to deliver more value like reinventing business processes, driving innovation and taking their data to the next level. And at Cloudscaling that’s what we work to deliver to  them, through our open hybrid cloud solution.

Results from the  [Rackspace Hybrid Cloud 2013 Survey](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-2013-hybrid-cloud-survey-results) found while the public cloud is great, it isn’t right for every application or workload.  According to the survey, 60% of respondents have moved or are considering moving certain applications or workloads either partially (41%) or completely (19%) off the public cloud because of its limitation or the potential benefits of other platform such as the hybrid cloud. The research also shows that the majority (60 percent) of IT decision-makers see hybrid cloud as the culmination of their cloud journey, rather than a stepping stone to using the public cloud alone for all their cloud needs.

So how do you get started with an OpenStack-powered hybrid cloud solution? Over the next few months, we’re hosting a webinar series with select partners like Redapt and CumuLogic to look deeper into hybrid cloud challenges, benefits, how to maximize ROI and move your business into a hybrid cloud architecture today. The webinars are listed below. Sign up today.
