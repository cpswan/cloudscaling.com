OpenStack gatherings keep getting bigger, just like the community of developers working on the project. Next week, a small army of OpenStack developers will on San Francisco for the [OpenStack Design Summit](http://openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/) and OpenStack Conference at the Hyatt Embarcadero.

On the first night of the event, [we’re hosting a party](http://artandopenstack.eventbrite.com/) with a distinctly San Francisco flavor at the famous 111 Minna Gallery a few blocks from the Hyatt Embarcadero. Your hosts for the night are Cloudscaling, [SolidFire](http://www.solidfire.com/) and [RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com/).

If you’re in town for the Summit, plan on joining us at 8:30 pm to celebrate the success of one of the fastest-growing projects in open source history with electronica DJs, party favors and t-shirts (Get there early if you want a t-shirt!). [RSVP now](http://artandopenstack.eventbrite.com/)!
