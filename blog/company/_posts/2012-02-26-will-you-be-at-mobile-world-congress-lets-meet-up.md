# Will you be at Mobile World Congress? Let’s meet up.

If you’re coming to [GSMA’s Mobile World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/index.html) in Barcelona, join us. We’ll be there with our partner Nokia Siemens Networks, talking about implementation of our Open Cloud System with carriers. If you’d like to meet up, please email Troy Angrignon: troy at cloudscaling dot com. See you there!
