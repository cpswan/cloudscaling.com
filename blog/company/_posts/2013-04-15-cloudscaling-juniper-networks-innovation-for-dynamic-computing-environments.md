# Cloudscaling + Juniper Networks: Innovation for Dynamic Computing Environments

### OpenStack is emerging as the de facto open source private cloud framework.

The [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) cloud computing software platform is the fastest-growing project in the history of open source. OpenStack Grizzly, the seventh major milestone release of OpenStack in less than three years, has become generally available after six months of active development, delivering powerful new features and some 7,620 patches contributed by 517 contributors globally.

Grizzly, incorporates the [three major components](http://www.openstack.org/software/) for building a cloud: compute, storage and network and is about making OpenStack scale and integrate with existing systems more easily. Users can now manage multiple OpenStack clouds through a single console; there are new drivers that ensure it is compatible with a wide range of products commonplace in the enterprise market, from vendors such as HP, IBM, VMware, NetApp and Red Hat, among others.

The OpenStack platform has matured to a point where enterprises can start to reliably use it to power next-generation computing workloads on their own private clouds. Real-world deployment stories are a central theme at this week's [OpenStack Summit](http://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/). Stories from industry leading companies such as [EVault](http://www.evault.com/), [IBS DataFort](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ibs-datafort-chooses-open-cloud-system-for-public-elastic-cloud-infrastructure-deployment/), [Ubisoft](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ubisoft-chooses-cloudscaling-open-cloud-system/) and [LivingSocial](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/livingsocial-chooses-open-cloud-system/) will put Cloudscaling at the center of the conversation.

Despite the momentum behind OpenStack and early customer success, there is still more work to be done to make it truly enterprise-ready.

### Delivering industry-leading OpenStack-powered solutions requires an ecosystem

Today, [Cloudscaling and Juniper Networks announced](/blog/press-releases/juniper/) a partnership that will integrate Juniper’s virtual network control technology – developed by Contrail – into Cloudscaling's Open Cloud System (OCS). Juniper chose Cloudscaling for several reasons:

  1. Cloudscaling engineers understand network engineering and cloud deployments at scale.
  2. Cloudscaling has the technical chops and experience to deliver to the most demanding enterprise customers.
  3. Cloudscaling uses 100% community OpenStack code. We do not fork OpenStack, and our customers take delivery of the source code.

Additionally, Juniper and Cloudscaling share a vision of the modern data center as well as an understanding of how the elastic cloud model and dynamic applications are revolutionizing the way IT services are delivered.

Customers expect highly agile, production-ready solutions, and the partnership with Juniper reflects that. As early leaders in SDN and the OpenStack community, respectively, Juniper and Cloudscaling understand the key disruptions driving cloud convergence and are uniquely qualified to deliver robust solutions that scale IP (internet protocol) service delivery and new application deployment. Alternative market solutions have failed to address the needs of enterprise and service provider customers who require a turnkey, open architecture, elastic cloud infrastructure solution that interoperates with existing data center and elastic public cloud environments.

Contrail's virtual network control technology does more than simply emulate a Layer-2 network. It solves many of the problems inherent in other designs that compromise the dynamic scaling capabilities that app developers expect of a Layer-3 network - IP reachability and network services including advanced security, horizontal scaling, and fault tolerance. With the Contrail controller and Open Cloud System, customers get what they expect: architectural and behavioral compatibility between Layer-2 and Layer-3 topologies that simplifies automation and supports today’s enterprise apps and tomorrow’s hybrid deployments.

### How the Juniper partnership transforms OCS and Cloudscaling

The deal is the first phase of an ongoing partnership in which the two companies will work together to leverage Cloudscaling’s leadership in OpenStack-based elastic cloud infrastructure and Juniper’s leadership in network innovation for enterprise data center customers.

In this first phase, the two companies are integrating Juniper VNC technology into Open Cloud System to enable the modernization of the traditional data center networking towards open, any-to-any fabrics where Layer-3 network services are moved closer to cloud-enabled application workloads. This approach emulates the cloud infrastructure (Virtual Private Cloud) architectures pioneered by hyper-scale web and cloud computing pioneers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google.

The new software-defined networking capabilities are implemented via OpenStack Quantum. Following validation with early access customers, general availability is slated for later this summer. The VPC capability will be delivered as an advanced feature module in [Open Cloud System 2.5](/blog/press-releases/ocs25/), which was announced today at the OpenStack Summit in Portland.

While the first step of the collaboration is integration of the Contrail controller into Open Cloud System to provide a new VPC capability, there are more announcements on the horizon. And, as our early access customers begin implementing the VPC product, you’ll hear more about how they’re using it and the results they’re achieving.
