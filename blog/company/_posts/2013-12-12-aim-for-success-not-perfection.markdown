Andrew Tahvildary joined Cloudscaling last month as Vice President of Engineering. He joins us most recently from [newScale](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/newscale.html#!), where he led the engineering team for more than six years as the company effected a successful exit via acquisition by Cisco. He was a member of the executive leadership team, responsible for product development and architecture, quality assurance, support, release management, program management and lifecycle budgeting for the engineering organization.

Before newScale, Andrew was engineering VP for [Primavera Systems](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/primavera/overview/index.html), prior to its acquisition by Oracle. In total, his engineering leadership experience stretches back nearly 20 years, covering a range of technical roles.

I spent a few minutes with Andrew discussing his experience and his philosophy of leading high-performing engineering organizations.

_RC: Let’s start with your experiences at newScale, Primavera and Evolve. What did those technical leadership roles teach you about building engineering teams at high-growth startups?_

AT: The key thing to any engineering team – startups or non-startups – is the people. If you don’t have the right people with the right level of skills, the right attitude and the right desire, you’re not going to be successful.

Second thing is that great teams typically have fun producing good results. I never had a team that didn’t have fun and produce a product that was any good. So, it really starts with the team in my opinion. 

After that it’s getting the right processes in place, the right technology, and the right strategic direction to be successful. My job is to create an environment for the teams to be successful.

_Building a productive interface between engineering and product development/management is critical in the environment of rapid iteration that software startups live in. Talk about your philosophy on building solid connections between engineering and product functions._

To me it’s all about teamwork, especially when you’re iterating really fast. You’re examining different ideas and different options and really going to into unknown areas every day. This is especially so in early stage markets. You really have to work very closely as a team; product management plus engineering. I see them as just one team quickly iterating and getting feedback to define the right solution for the market that we’re going after. This has been the case at every successful startup I’ve been with.

_Is the role of engineering leadership for a company leveraging an open source project different than the same role in a walled garden?_

If I look at it from 30,000 feet, it’s almost the same.

At the end of the day you need to build a product that people find useful and useable, one that’s unique and a lot of people want to use. The market demands products that are simple to use, simple to implement, simple to get value from. But  the key thing is in both areas – open source or proprietary software – you have to build things that are unique and that meet a broad market demand to be successful.

When you come to details there are different processes that you have to go through obviously, like the go to market strategy. But as far as building the products, it’s very similar. Of course, today, nobody builds everything from scratch anyway.

_Hybrid cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises that want to embrace ideas like elastic cloud and agile development. That’s a disruptive shift for most enterprises. What are the biggest concerns you’ve heard from enterprise IT when evaluating a new technology that will transform longstanding processes?_

Most IT organizations are risk averse, but I think the market is moving more in the direction of open source, so enterprises are learning how to evaluate that risk.

You also have to deal with different skills sets for two different types of cloud. Typically if you have one side of the IT organization managing the public cloud like AWS, another group will manage the private cloud, whether that’s VMware or someone else.

The question becomes, how do you bridge that skill gap? How do you deal with SLAs across these things? How do you move applications? Before they knew how to manage their data center. But now when you open it up and you go to public cloud and hybrid cloud, are the two technologies the same? Are they working on the same set of APIs? How do you manage them? How do you support them? How you maintain things across?

Those are the concerns people have – the complexity of how you manage two very different cloud paradigms.

_What is your first priority at Cloudscaling?_

My first priority is to get to know the team, then get to know the product a little bit better. Then, we’ll develop an environment for us to be ready to get to the next step as an engineering organization. I think we’ve done a great job to get to this point and there are tons of things we can do that accelerate our velocity, our innovation as well as making it a fun place to be. 

One of the key things that I’ve learned in different startups is that you should aim for success, not perfection. That’s really key thing.

Aim for success, not perfection.

_Thanks, Andrew. And welcome to Cloudscaling._

You’re welcome. It’s great to be here.
