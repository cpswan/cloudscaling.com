# Tarkan Maner Joins Cloudscaling Board of Directors

Today I am extremely pleased to welcome Tarkan Maner, CEO of Nexenta and previously CEO of Wyse technologies, to Cloudscaling’s board of directors. The full press release can be found [here](http://tickerreport.com/press-releases/219190/nexenta-ceo-tarkan-maner-joins-cloudscaling-board-of-directors/).

I met Tarkan during our search for a new CEO and found him to be a passionate entrepreneur with a strong desire to help Cloudscaling succeed. Tarkan and I share similar characteristics. We are both super high energy personalities. We are both intensely keen on cloud. However, we also come from two different worlds: sales/ marketing vs. technology. And that contrast makes all all the difference.

One thing I pride myself on is finding new members of the team who fill in existing capability gaps. Or those who bring completely new capabilities and skills to the table. Here, I think Tarkan’s track record speaks for itself. He has built and led high growth businesses, like [Wyse](http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-05-25-dell-acquisitions-wyse), into the cloud future. I am very much looking forward to learning from Tarkan’s experience and wisdom and his desire to join our board, with so many others courting him is a massive vote of confidence in myself, my co-founder Adam Waters, our business, and the rest of the Cloudscaling team.

Great to have you onboard, Tarkan!

Best,

—Randy
