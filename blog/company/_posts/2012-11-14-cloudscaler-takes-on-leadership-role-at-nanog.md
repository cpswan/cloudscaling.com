# Cloudscaler takes on leadership role at NANOG

Network operations is a critical component of cloud operations. Our engineering team has not only designed and built elastic cloud infrastructure for some of the biggest names out there, but they’ve operated them at scale.  
  
Part of that background includes longtime participation in the industry associations that support network operations. Earlier this month, Dan Sneddon, a leader on the Cloudscaling engineering team, was voted in as Chairman of the Communications Committee for [NANOG, the North American Network Operators Group](http://www.nanog.org/). A big part of NANOG’s mission is to facilitate interaction among engineers by maintaining a 13,000-strong mailing list. That’s one of the roles of Dan’s committee.  
  
NANOG is the largest organization for network operations professionals. In addition to his leadership of the Communications Committee, Dan also now serves on the NANOG board.  
  
Congratulations to Dan on a *major* vote of confidence from his peers!
