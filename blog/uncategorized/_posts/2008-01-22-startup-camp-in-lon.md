# Startup Camp in LON

The folks at [Startup Camp](http://www.startupcamp.org/) are hosting a brand new London camp, which should be quite interesting. On mentioning it to a few folks in the U.K. I thought might be interested it was pointed out that yours truly makes a couple of brief cameos in the new Startup Camp promotional video. I hate to be blatantly self-promotional, but maybe my appearances will lead to some kind of new acting career. :-) Check [the video](http://wcdata.sun.com/webcast/download/07B00849/07B00849_00_300.mp4) out!
