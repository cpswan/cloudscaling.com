# Cloudscaling CEO Recent Quotes

Greetings and Happy New Year. Apologies that things have been silent around here. I can assure you the entire Cloudscaling team has been extremely busy. We have a bunch of great new content coming along for the blog that should be interesting to discuss, particularly around public IaaS cloud growth and velocity. In the meantime, though, I was recently quoted in a couple of articles. [First on IBM's cloud strategy](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240030797/IBMs-cloud-computing-strategy-Flying-blind) (spoiler: there is none). Second, on the [Microsoft Azure blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2011/01/26/thought-leaders-in-the-cloud-talking-with-randy-bias-cloud-computing-pioneer-and-expert.aspx). As usual, I didn't pull any punches, so they should both be entertaining reads. Again, hope you had a fantastic start to your year and we look forward to the continued engagement and discussion of cloud computing here and in the blogosphere in general. \--Randy
