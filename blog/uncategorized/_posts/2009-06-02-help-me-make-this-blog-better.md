# Help Me Make This Blog Better

Please help me make the Cloudscaling blog better.  If you would take a moment of your time to fill out the following survey I would really appreciate it.  It's extremely short.  Just three questions.  Your input is valued highly. **UPDATE**:  Had a great response.  Closed the survey.  Here were the results: 1\.  Do you prefer articles that are shorter, longer, or a mix? 

  * 8% - Short is sweet
  * 17% - I've got time and focus, give me details
  * 75% - Mix it up so I don't know what to expect
2\. Do you enjoy reading more technical content? Business-oriented?  Or a mix? 
  * 33% - I prefer technical content
  * 25% - I like it high level and business-focused
  * 42% - Give me everything you've got
3\. Do you consume this blog's content move via browser or an RSS feed? 
  * 26% - Browser
  * 74% - RSS Feed
Needless to say I found this very interesting.  It could be that a certain kind of respondent self-selected, but there is a decided leaning towards folks who want to read more involved technical articles in their RSS readers. Thanks to everyone that responded.  It is extremely helpful to have your input.
