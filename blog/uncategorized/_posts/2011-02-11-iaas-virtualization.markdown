Just a brief note to highlight a fairly obvious misconception, so please excuse if I am preaching to the choir.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is not virtualization-on-demand.  I realize that there is a certain amount of terminology hijacking by marketers, but when you say 'IaaS', I don't think 'virtual servers on demand', I think of 'infrastructure on demand', which includes: servers, storage (block and object), networking, DNS, and related.

Simply put:


<blockquote>Virtualization ≠ IaaS</blockquote>


I know many of you are clear on this.  I'm just taking a strong stand on the poisoning or dilution of the definition of IaaS.
