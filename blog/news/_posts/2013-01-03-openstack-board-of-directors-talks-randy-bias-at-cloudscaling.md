# OpenStack board of directors talks: Randy Bias at Cloudscaling

OpenStack will be broadly adopted by the enterprise over time. If you look at other open source projects such as Hadoop â€¦ it gives the average enterprise a competitiveness that Google previously had with MapReduce. Many companies are comfortable with Hadoop already, and I believe the same will happen with OpenStack over time.
