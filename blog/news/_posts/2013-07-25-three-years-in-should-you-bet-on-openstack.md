# Three years in, should you bet on OpenStack?

...there is the notion of AWS compatibility and interoperability with OpenStack, which is also lacking. There are views, such as that from [Randy Bias at Cloudscaling](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/missing-the-point-on-private-public-and-hybrid-cloud-apis/), that OpenStack should work and play well with AWS to be successful.
