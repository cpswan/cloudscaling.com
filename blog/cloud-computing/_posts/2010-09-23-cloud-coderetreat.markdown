Cloudscaling and the great crew fromÂ [Cloudkick](https://www.cloudkick.com/) want you to come sharpen your cloud coding skills Saturday, Nov 6th, 2010.

Yes, it's a Saturday. Yes, it's pretty much all day. Yes, it will be fun.

Bring a laptop and the willingness to teach and learn from each other.

This one will be all about Python. (the language of [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/))

We'll bring food.

Please [RSVP](http://cloudcoderetreat.eventbrite.com/)
