_(This is an edited version of a post that originally appeared at my personal blog, [constructolution](http://constructolution.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/openstack-la-meetup/).)_

Last week I took a trip down to L.A. to attend the [#OSLAX meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-LA/events/70328332/) and presented my talk on “Openstack IRL,” which seemed to be very well received.

The [video](http://vimeo.com/46701640) of my talk is up on Vimeo if you’re interested in hearing the actual presentation, or you can see the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/pgutheb/openstack-in-real-life) on Slideshare. The message was the same as when I presented to #lspe [earlier this year](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/production-engineering-and-openstack/): You *can* build a production cloud using Openstack. Cloudscaling has done it. This time around I was able to provide a little more detail about some of the specifics of what we at Cloudscaling are doing in our Open Cloud System, especially around resiliency for internal OpenStack components, networking and AWS compatibility.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments.
