I recently gave a short, 5-minute 'lightning talk' at [Cloud Camp in the Clouds](http://www.cloudcamp.com/?page_id=1429).  This is the first 'virtual' (online) event for the [Cloud Camp](http://www.cloudcamp.com) folks.  I want to particularly thank the organizers [Reuven Cohen](http://www.elasticvapor.com), [Dave Nielsen](http://www.platformd.com/), and [Sam Charrington](http://cloudpulseblog.com/) for allowing me to give our perspective and also to let us tee up the entire event as the first presenter.  A recording of the entire event is in the works, but I wanted to reproduce my presentation here to get it out sooner.

So here is a recreation of the talk including my original deck, which has my fonts (the perfectionist in me, I can't help it), and a professional (sort of) quality voice-over.  I'd also like to thank the [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net) folks whose audio synchronization tool was a cinch to use.
