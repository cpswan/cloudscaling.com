# Cloud-native, cloud-centric, or cloud-ready?

I want to try an experiment.  Hopefully it won't bite me...

I am trying to understand if we are close to a consensus on the new apps driving all of the cloud growth.  Cloud-native is a term positioned by the folks at [MessageBus](http://www.messagebus.com), cloud-ready is what we at Cloudscaling have been using for a while, and cloud-centric is an IBM-ism.

Here's the experiment.  I want to try using [Branch](http://branch.com/b/the-next-big-thing-cloud-native-application-services) to facilitate a better discussion than Disqus and Twitter allow.  Hopefully this will work and I ask for your patience and participation.
