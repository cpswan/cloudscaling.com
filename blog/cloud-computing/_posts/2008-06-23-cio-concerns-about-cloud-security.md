# CIO Concerns about Cloud Security

There is a little [here](http://www.cioupdate.com/article.php/10761_3752881_1) on CIOupdate about CIO concerns with cloud security. The article is short and a little overblown in how both sides are represented. I'm currently talking to CIOs and CISOs at large enterprises and I'm not hearing any 'panic' so much as pragmatic concerns about securing cloud usage. The folks who are in charge of evaluating cloud services seem to be more concerned about auditability, accountability, and cost controls than enforcing enterprise security mechanisms on cloud systems. To paraphrase a VP of Enterprise IT at a Fortune 50 company 

> This looks like an identity management problem to me. I'm more concerned about knowing what a user stored in the cloud or what servers are in use. How do I remove those files or turn off those servers when that user leaves us?

[CloudScale](http://www.cloudscale.net) will elegantly enable the secure management of clouds. Best of all, it was developed by infrastructure and security experts!
