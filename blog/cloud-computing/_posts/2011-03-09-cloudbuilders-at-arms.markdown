<blockquote>The rising tide raises all boats.</blockquote>



Today Rackspace announced a new OpenStack governance model and Cloudbuilders to provide commercial support and training for OpenStack.

Rackspace Cloudbuilders gives the OpenStack ecosystem a formal center of gravity for organizations needing help to work through the many choices the framework doesn't make for them. Before Cloudbuilders, organizations were on their own to fill in many blanks. This can be overwhelming for organizations lacking domain expertise or the dynamics of open source projects. Acquiring either of those things can be a daunting task.

Cloudbuilders will accelerate OpenStack's transition from a collection of code repositories with an ecosystem of developers to an ecosystem of organizations providing services. Organizations will no longer be left to their own devices, literally and figuratively.

This transition to more code running on real hardware providing production services will help to focus the OpenStack community on the real challenges we are all facing. Accelerating the community of OpenStack installations will enable us all to start finding solutions based on data.

Cloudscaling has built many relationships throughout Rackspace and with the great people formerly known as Anso Labs. Cloudscaling looks forward to working together with Cloudbuilders to build up the ecosystem and contribute to the body of knowledge about deploying and managing cloud infrastructures.

Now we have to get back to building...
