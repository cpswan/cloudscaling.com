# Must Read on “The” Cloud

I don't often post simple links or even lists of interesting links. I prefer to try and provide more infrequent, but original content. I'm going to make an exception today because I want to point you to a really fantastic article by MasterMark:     [The Enterprise Cloud](http://jroller.com/MasterMark/entry/the_enterprise_cloud) Fair warning, this is a very long blog entry, but it really touches on a number of different thoughts and memes that have been wandering through the cloud computing community's thinking for a while now. In particular, I think there are some very cogent observations about what is 'the cloud' vs. 'cloud computing' and how the enterprise fits in. As an added bonus you get a pretty deep dive into [VPN-Cubed](http://www.cohesiveft.com/vpncubed) from [CohesiveFT](http://www.cohesiveft.com/). I consider this one a must read folks!

**[Jeff Hardy from SmarterTools](#47 "2008-12-23 19:14:01"):** Cloudy Issues / Clear Answers: the benefits and challenges I recently had the opportunity to present on the topic of Cloud Computing from the perspective of my employerâ€”SmarterTools, an independent developer of Web-based applications. It was at PubCon in Las Vegas and I sat on a panel with Mike Culver from Amazon Web Services. My take was to separate truth from hype. The feedback was overwhelming! So much so that we followed it up with an article and a copy of the presentation: http://www.smartertools.com/blog/archive/2008/11/20/cloud-computing-challenges-benefits-and-the-future.aspx As Cloud Computing gains market share and market buzz, it is important for us to remember what it really is andâ€”perhaps more importantlyâ€”what it really isnâ€™t. Be well, Jeffrey J. Hardy http://www.smartertools.com
