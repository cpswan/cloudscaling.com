What is the end game for cloud computing and the ecosystem around it?  This is always hard to predict, but I recently had a rather obvious epiphany about what it might look like.  Sometimes the obvious answers are also the best.

Let me explain.
<!-- more -->
A few things before starting.  First, I'm coming at this with a decided bias towards the enterprise (small, medium, and large) as that's where our [product](http://www.cloudscale.net/service) is targeted.  Second, many of these ideas aren't necessarily new, but I haven't seen them combined quite like this or this exact conclusion drawn.  Third, it might seem at first that I'm backpedalling on my [prior assertion](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/short-sighted-about-cloud-computing) that SaaS isn't 'cloud computing' and to some degree I am, but I think the final decision is still out, so bear with me to the end.

For some background, I recommend reading Michael Sheehan's [Cloud Pyramid taxonomy](http://blog.gogrid.com/2008/06/24/the-cloud-pyramid/).

**What is a Service?**
It's pretty important to define this before proceeding.  I like this technology interpretation of what a computing 'service' is:


<blockquote>
Specialized, software-based functionality provided by network servers for example, directory services that provide the network equivalent of "phone books" needed for locating users and resources.
</blockquote>



But this doesn't quite capture what a service is in the economic sense.  Wikipedia helps us out [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_%28economics%29):


<blockquote>
A service is the non-material equivalent of a good. A service provision is an economic activity that does not result in ownership, and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods.
</blockquote>



Taken like this it's easy to understand why we talk about "[internal customers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_customers)".  An IT department provides services to internal customers.  In fact, providing services is probably the dominant way that departments 'sell' to internal customers.

I think that in this context talking about Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) takes on a new meaning.  SaaS is generally considered an Internet service, but if we expand the definition just a bit to assume it's any software delivered as a service, even internal to an enterprise, then suddenly it's much easier to talk about what the inevitable cloud economy looks like both inside and outside the firewall.

**Cloud Economy Taxonomy**
The epiphany I had is basically that while SaaS might not be cloud computing, it's certainly part of the cloud computing economy.  In fact, if you think about it, long term, it makes sense that everyone focuses on one part of the following stack based on their target market.  The biggest players will inevitably build all three parts of this stack (e.g. Google's Gmail), but most folks will wind up focusing on building infrastructure, platforms, **or** software.  Not all three at once.
