Great [podcast](http://www.bluemountainlabs.com/podcast/2446) this morning with David Linthicum and Bill Russell o[f Blue Mountain Labs](http://www.bluemountainlabs.com/).  Dave kept it lively and fast-paced as usual, so it won't take you long to listen.

We covered:



	
  * The recent AWS outage

	
  * Why you need two cloud providers

	
  * The Federal Government's inability to adopt cloud compute

	
  * How big will the cloud *really* be?

	
  * ... and my recent development of shooting as a hobby


Not sure why folks are surprised that an avowed west coast liberal enjoys using firearms, but it's a nice change of pace from all cloud, all the time.  :-)

Please listen to the podcast [HERE](http://www.bluemountainlabs.com/podcast/2446) on the Blue Mountain Labs website.  You can follow David Linthicum and Bill Russell on twitter as [@DavidLinthicum](http://twitter.com/DavidLinthicum) and [@BillatBML](http://twitter/BillatBML) respectively.
