# OpenStack Design Summit 2011 - Schedule

There has been a little bit of confusion on the schedule for the upcoming OpenStack Design Summit.  It is running Tuesday through Friday this week in Santa Clara.  The complete schedule can be found at this [link](http://openstack-spring2011.sched.org/).  You can register [here](http://www.cvent.com/events/openstack-design-summit-spring-2011/event-summary-51c521e3af73406dbc548746c25423c4.aspx), although there is now apparently a wait list. I will be one of the panelists on the [Governance Policy Panel](http://openstack-spring2011.sched.org/event/9520d1b4ec461e6f8c190100e606e6bd) Tuesday at 4pm.  This is a good opportunity to get involved in the discussion around how OpenStack should be organized. For those who are want to connect with me while there, I recommend coordinating via Twitter ([@randybias](http://twitter.com/randybias)).
