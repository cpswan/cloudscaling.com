Randy's comments are mostly in the 9:00 to 35:00 minute window but the audio was off from 9:00 - 17:22 so it's a bit faint in the first half.

Some of the questions that are addressed in this talk include:



	
  * What is the current landscape for cloud computing?

	
  * What are the issues now?

	
  * Which issues are key?

	
  * Is security a real issue?

	
  * How do I use cloud while maintaining my compliance?

	
  * Who is using cloud inside the enterprise? Apps teams or Infrastructure teams?

	
  * How should cloud service providers think about cloud?

	
  * How big of a deal is cloud?

	
  * What are the entrepreneurial opportunities?


Thanks to John Furrier and the [SiliconAngle.tv](http://www.siliconangle.tv) team for a great interview.
