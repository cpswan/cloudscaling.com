 Two independent analysts who have contributed an unvarnished voice of pragmatism to the cloud conversation are Ben Kepes of [Diversity Limited](http://diversity.net.nz/) and Krishnan Subramanian of [Rishidot](http://krishworld.com/). They've made a name for themselves in providing points of view that everyone might not always agree with, but everyone respects because they bring  thoughtful analysis and clarity to a space that's often obfuscated.

Ben and Krish have taken a bold step, and we at Cloudscaling are happy to help them. They've launched a one-day event focused on perturbing the steady-state system of cloud thought leadership by going beyond vendor stories and cloudwashed application profiles to think about questions that matter to cloud buyers going forward.

Their event, [Cloud 2020 Summit](http://cloud2020summit.com/), is a small, invitation-only gathering of about 75 buyers, vendors and pundits. ([apply here](http://cloud2020.eventbrite.com/))

[Check out the agenda](http://cloud2020summit.com/agenda/), and apply to attend. If you're coming to Las Vegas for Interop, it'll be easy enough to join in, and it should be well worth your time.
