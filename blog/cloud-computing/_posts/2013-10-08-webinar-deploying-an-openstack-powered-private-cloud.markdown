Cloudscaling gets asked these questions frequently – weekly if not daily.

  * Is OpenStack production ready?
  * Can’t I just download OpenStack from openstack.org for free?
  * Are vendor OpenStack implementations incompatible with each other?
  * Are all nine OpenStack projects essential to standing up a IaaS cloud?
  * Are only OpenStack public clouds compatible with OpenStack private clouds?
  * Is OpenStack a drop-in replacement for VMware vSphere and vCloud Suite?
  * Other than hardware, what are other non-OpenStack considerations when building a private cloud?

To be honest, initially we ourselves were stumped since the answers are not cut and dry. But the more we developed and deployed our OpenStack-powered system for customers in the last 18 months, the clearer the answers to these questions became for us. And these answers have shaped how our Open Cloud System (OCS) product and market approach has evolved in 2013.

At a high level, these are our conclusions about building OpenStack-powered private clouds:

  * OpenStack is disruptive – The best OpenStack implementations and recommendations don’t come from your established trusted sources, internal or external. Whether it’s your systems guy or your trusted networking vendor (and by extension their reseller partners), you’ll want to get a second opinion. Most likely you’ll be dealing with someone new.
  * OpenStack is not trivial – Companies severely underestimate their necessary investments adjacent to adopting OpenStack, namely x86 systems, storage, networking, automated provisioning, co-location facility, training and post-deployment management capabilities. You can’t just sprinkle OpenStack pixie dust on your aging datacenter or vMotion a workload over from a vSphere cluster. It’s a rethink of the IT stack from the concrete up.
  * With OpenStack, there’s safety in numbers – With the exception of a handful of well-funded organizations, companies should *not* design, build and maintain their own one-off OpenStack private cloud. You’ll be stuck maintaining a system – probably forked and highly customized – that only you know how to maintain. This DIY OpenStack penalty overwhelms any short-term benefits for most companies.
  * OpenStack is perfect for a “hybrid cloud first” strategy – The flexibility inherent in OpenStack makes it ideal for federating to AWS, GCE or other public elastic clouds. Going “hybrid first” preserves IT agility while maintaining control and reducing risk to boost ROI.

In our [Thursday webinar](http://go.cloudscaling.com/cloudscaling-fall-2013-webinar-series), I’ll expand on these topics, and as a bonus, I’ll provide you with answers to the questions posed at the beginning of this post. (Well, at least with my biased responses!)
