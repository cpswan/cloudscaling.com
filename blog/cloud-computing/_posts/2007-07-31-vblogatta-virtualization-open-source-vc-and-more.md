# Vblogatta: Virtualization, Open Source, VC, and More

Lots to report on various fronts soon, but thought I would point to a [new blog](http://aleinwand.blogspot.com/) that I discovered by Allan Leinwand, one of the partners at [Panorama Capital](http://www.panoramacapital.com/). Some great posts on [Vyatta](http://www.vyatta.com/), an open source IP router player. Allan clearly knows his stuff and has some great perspectives.

**[Joel Wineland](#3090 "2011-11-02 05:24:00"):** Great post and very good points. - We are proud to represent the foundation and are very interested in any opportunity to collaborate on designs that could sensibly broaden the scope and applicability of OCP. I'm looking forward to a very bright future driven by a broad group of users cooperating in product management and design activities that pave the way for refined, efficient and innovative developments. Facebook kicked this off, and continues to innovate, but the success of this initiative will be determined by a much broader community. This will be exactly what we make it! We need to lay out and stack rank requirements with a willingness to compromise. We need to break down closed and pointless competitive barriers and stop demanding NDA's. There is real value here, but we have to work together to assert it.

**[randybias](#3091 "2011-11-02 19:47:00"):** Joel, I'm very gratified to hear you say that. I can't wait for Open Compute to grow and turn into a fantastic vehicle for collaboration and innovation. \--Randy

**[Evan Powell](#3093 "2011-11-06 10:36:00"):** "Break down closed and pointless competitive barriers" +1.  As Andy B put it at OSS11, "gratuitous differentiation" is everywhere.  We need our servers to do compute at scale.  That *is* a broad concept that I strongly believe the leading makers of hardware recognize has broader application than just Facebook or just new data centers.  Certainly it fits 100% with OpenStorage which includes customers from 8-12TB into the hundreds of PBs.
