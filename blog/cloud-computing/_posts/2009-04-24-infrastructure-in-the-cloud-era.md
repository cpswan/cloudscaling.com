# Infrastructure in the Cloud Era

Great deck from [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/) of [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com) and [Adam Jacob](http://twitter.com/adamhjk) of [OpsCode](http://www.opscode.com) giving a high level overview of how to manage infrastructure for clouds.  The mantra of "program your infrastructure" continues to gain momentum.  There isn't going to be a place for systems admins and operators who cannot write code in the future.  Unless you just want to be replacing disk drives as an occupation?
