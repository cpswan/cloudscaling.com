At Cloud Connect earlier this month, Randy Bias spoke with Paul Burns about open clouds, OpenStack, cloud-ready apps and cloud operators finding differentiation in higher layers of the stack rather than in the infrastructure.

The [12-minute podcast](http://www.neovise.com/podcast-cloud-connect-2012-cloudscaling-open-cloud-computing) covers a lot of ground. Enjoy!
