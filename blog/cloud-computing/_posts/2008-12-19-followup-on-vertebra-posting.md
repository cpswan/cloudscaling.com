# Followup on Vertebra Posting

Earlier I posted asking [What Happened to Vertebra?](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/what-happened-to-vertebra/), the sysadmin cloud management tool that [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/) had promised for 'end of summer'. Pleased to see that the EY folks soft released an early BETA of the code today. You can see more at their [github repo](http://github.com/engineyard/vertebra/tree/master). To be fair, this is the very first external release of this tool, so you shouldn't be setting expectations too high nor should you be playing with it unless you're an early adopter and comfortable with dealing with complex sysadmin tools. Also, most of the core is written in Erlang, which is still not a widely adopted language. Pretty excited to take a close look. There is a lot of promise here.

**Update: **Here is the [official Vertebra home page](http://www.engineyard.com/vertebra), which gives more of a high level picture of the tool.

**[Paul Annesley](#54 "2008-12-21 22:21:37"):** Nice - thanks for pointing this out. We've also been waiting for some word from Engine Yard about this project - looks very interesting.
