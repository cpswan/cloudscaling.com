# OpenStack Skills: Critical for the new Cloud Era

We live in a world where the cloud is a key component of IT’s ability to become agile, accelerate innovation and open up entirely new ways of competing. As enterprises continue their movement to the cloud, there is also a need for the IT profession to make a similar shift.

According to an [IDC study funded by Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2012/mar12/03-05CloudComputingJobs.aspx), cloud computing will generate nearly 14 million new jobs between by 2015. And according to a recent TechTarget survey, 40% of respondents admit they're struggling to hire engineers and developers with cloud experience. Looking at the results of these and other studies like the [BSA Global Computing Scorecard](http://cloudscorecard.bsa.org/) reveals an underlying theme: there isn't enough cloud talent to go around.

At Cloudscaling, we believe the lack of OpenStack skills is preventing IT departments and software developers from taking advantage of the kinds of tools that will truly allow a data center to modernize. In order for OpenStack to turn the corner and become mainstream, vendors must educate the market on how to mitigate risks when adopting OpenStack as well as develop a workforce that will take the organization into the future.

To that end, Cloudscaling is launching an [OpenStack training program](http://www.cloudscaling.com/services/training/) to help bridge the skill gap among IT professionals in the new cloud era. Our goal is to create a way for people to get trained in OpenStack and open-source elastic cloud technologies that they can’t get anywhere else. Beyond teaching the fundamentals of OpenStack, we believe it’s necessary to train people how to think differently about the way IT gets delivered as well as how to create the right cloud delivery strategy - public, private or hybrid - for their business.

Our initial focus will be on teaching OpenStack, because that's where we see the biggest need in the market. We’re kicking things off this fall with a handful of classes:

  * Cloud Computing with Openstack
  * Cloudscaling Bootcamp for OpenStack
  * Cloud Storage with OpenStack Swift

Cloud Computing with OpenStack is designed to help IT and business executives understand how cloud computing – powered by OpenStack – differs from traditional IT and why this matters to their business. We also teach students about the market, the ecosystem of products, and risks to consider with DIY when it comes to deploying a private cloud.

### // [FALL WEBINAR SERIES: Register for "Deploying an OpenStack-powered Private Cloud," Oct 10 at 10am PDT ](http://go.cloudscaling.com/cloudscaling-fall-2013-webinar-series)//

 

For the more hands-on technical crowd, we’re offering two courses right out of the gate: Cloudscaling Fundamentals with OpenStack and Cloud Storage with OpenStack Swift. The fundamentals course covers everything you need to know about deploying and operating OpenStack to power compute services, using components such as Nova, Glance, Keystone, Horizon, and Cinder. The storage course dives into resilient, distributed object storage using Swift. These two courses will be geared primarily toward systems, network, and DevOps engineers looking to dig into the nuts and bolts of what it really takes to make OpenStack go.

We are in the open cloud era and OpenStack is leading the charge. Don’t fall behind - realign your skills to be a part of one of the fastest growing open source projects to date.

[Registration is now open](http://www.cloudscaling.com/services/training/). We’ll see you in the classroom.
