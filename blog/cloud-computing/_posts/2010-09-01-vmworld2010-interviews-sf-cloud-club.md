# Randy Bias panel at #VMWorld2010

John Furrier interviewed the following members of the SF Cloud Computing Club today at [VMWorld 2010](http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2010/) for an episode of [SiliconAngle.tv](http://www.siliconangle.tv)'s TheCube series. 

  * Rich Miller, Managing Director & Principal, Cumulati

The video clip is below:

[Watch live video from #theCube from SiliconANGLE.tv on Justin.tv](http://www.justin.tv/nicefishfilms#r=fSNRuxY~&s=em) Randy's comments are mostly in the 9:00 to 35:00 minute window but the audio was off from 9:00 - 17:22 so it's a bit faint in the first half. Some of the questions that are addressed in this talk include: 

  * What is the current landscape for cloud computing?
  * What are the issues now?
  * Which issues are key?
  * Is security a real issue?
  * How do I use cloud while maintaining my compliance?
  * Who is using cloud inside the enterprise? Apps teams or Infrastructure teams?
  * How should cloud service providers think about cloud?
  * How big of a deal is cloud?
  * What are the entrepreneurial opportunities?
Thanks to John Furrier and the [SiliconAngle.tv](http://www.siliconangle.tv) team for a great interview.

Well said. On your comments that there are a number of clever ways to to be a part of this huge emerging opportunity of the pervasive Cloud computing services in the next decade or two. Apart from Cloud computing paradigm emerging as a catalyst and an agent of change for the businesses, There is a going to be a number of opportunities for technocrats,developers,consultants , CIOs etc to bring and be a part of such a change.
