# Amazon Web Services' Rapid Release Cycle

Last year I asked: "[Is Amazon Web Services Winning the Cloud Race?](/blog/cloud-computing/is-amazon-winning-the-cloud-race)" And during the [Cloud Connect 2011](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/) keynote this week I made some assertions that AWS is indeed running away with the ball and backed it up with actual numbers[1]. In addition to the keynote, I provided some updated information on AWS releases during panels I moderated this week at Cloud Connect.  Some audience members requested more details. I wanted to provide these details for everyone. But first as a reminder, here's the graphic showing Amazon's development momentum by showing 'significant' feature releases per year: [caption id="attachment_1728" align="aligncenter" width="518" caption="AWS Release Counts by Year"]![](http://cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/cloudscaling-cloud-connect-2011-keynote-randybias-aws-releases1.png)[/caption] This shows a strong development cycle and continued momentum on Amazon's part.  The light grey bar on the right indicates a rough prediction for releases this year (2011).  If AWS meets this, that would be roughly 5-6 'significant' releases per month. The source data, originally in a Google Doc, is published [here](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/pub?key=0Aj44T5bMC9D5dG1QWlRKNmctRk5EcW5mSkhQbEQ5akE&output=html) and we appreciate any thoughts or feedbacks you have into our basic methodology shown in '[decision criteria](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/pub?key=0Aj44T5bMC9D5dG1QWlRKNmctRk5EcW5mSkhQbEQ5akE&gid=0)' tab.  This is how we decided if something was 'significant' or not. **UPDATED**: Changes made for clarification due to great feedback from Chris Hoff ([@Beaker](http://twitter.com/Beaker)).
