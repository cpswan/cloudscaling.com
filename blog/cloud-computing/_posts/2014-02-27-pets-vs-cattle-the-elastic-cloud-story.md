# Pets vs. Cattle: The Elastic Cloud Story

Last night I presented at the Chicago DevOps Meetup along with [@mattokeefe](https://twitter.com/mattokeefe) and [@mfdii](http://twitter.com/mfdii).  The presentation went very well and was warmly received.  It's a bit of a revisit of some topics I have covered before, such as [Pets vs. Cattle](http://www.slideshare.net/randybias/architectures-for-open-and-scalable-clouds), the [new kind of elastic cloud](http://www.slideshare.net/randybias/enterprise-cloud-myths), and the architectural patterns involved with building these new kinds of clouds.  I did a major refresh though and am weaving the threads a bit differently than before.

I hope you enjoy it.
