# Sponsoring Gluecon

I'm averaging over 10 tech conferences a year for the last few years. I believe there is an unmeasurable personal value that comes with participating in conferences that is hard to explain to someone who doesn't already understand the value of connecting to a network of talented and motivated experts in a field.  As a result, I accumulated a ridiculous amount of 'vendor paraphernalia'. All manner of handouts, pamphlets, CDs, DVDs, flash drives and t-shirts, the majority of which had a negligible or perhaps even negative impact on my impression of the brands. The discussion of what Cloudscaling should do as a sponsor went through the usual list of things one might find thrown in the garbage at most conferences. Someone asked me what I would like to see from a sponsor and after mentally going through the piles of conference swag I have received, I responded 'carbon offsets', believing no one would think that was a good idea. I was pleasantly surprised to find I was mistaken. After a brief effort dissuading the idea that putting something small 'letting people know' in the conference bags, I convinced our team it was enough to just do it and write this. To those of you who wanted to get Cloudscaling branded T-shirts/trucker hats/flashdrives, my personal apologies, but I hope we can all pause and consider the resources required to create these events. I know I take this for granted most the time. If you would like to learn more about what Cloudscaling does or are [looking for adventure](/company/careers.html) reach out to myself, Andrew Clay Shafer, (andrew at cloudscaling or [@littleidea](http://twitter.com/littleidea)) or Paul Guth (gunther at cloudscaling).
