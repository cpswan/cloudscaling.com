# Massive MySQL & ZFS Scale-Up Capability

This [article](http://blogs.sun.com/mrbenchmark/entry/scaling_mysql_on_a_256) shows how easy it is to throw hardware at a problem and 'scale up' and part of why I think it's clear that using virtual machines in a cloud alone isn't sufficient. Some times you can solve problems by throwing hardware at it. Yes... That's 79,000 SQL queries per second on a 4U rackmount system. Yes, it's not elegant, but it works and it's cheaper than people.
