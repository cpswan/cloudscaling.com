Cloudscaling has been hard at work building clouds, but not so hard that we don't try to stop and listen.

For anyone following the clouds space, these names probably don't need an introduction, but sometimes it is nice to introduce people, even when their reputations precede them.

We are pleased to [announce that Ben Black, Chris Brown and Simon Wardley have joined our board of advisors](http://bit.ly/b1zEtg).

The whole cloud space wouldn't be what it is today without major contributions from each one of them.Â That's not just our cloud story, that's 'THE' cloud story.

We look forward to putting their advice into action.
