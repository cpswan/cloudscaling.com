Cloud-Oriented Architectures (COA) mentioned briefly [before](http://neotactics.com/blog/uncategorized/clouds-are-not-datacenters/) by me look to be coming of age with this [latest announcement](http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/12/07/forcecom-google-app-engine-cloud-relationship-management/) from Force.com and Google App Engine.

Hopefully this will help get the message across.  Building your entire application stack is soooo 1999...
