# GoGrid Makes the Gartner Magic Quadrant

![Gartner Magic Quadrant for Hosting/Cloud]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2009/07/168687_0001.png) This slipped by me, but looks like [GoGrid](http://www.gogrid.com) made the famous Gartner 'magic quadrant' for [Web Hosting and](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/gogrid/article2/article2.html)[ Hosted Cloud Infrastructure Services (On Demand)](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/gogrid/article2/article2.html).[1]  You can see the quadrant here to the right. It's great that GoGrid is listed in the visionary quadrant.  When I joined GoGrid in the office of the CTO, one of my explicit goals was to increase the view of GoGrid as a thought leader and visionary in the cloud computing space.  It gratifies me to see the recognition by Gartner. For those of you who may have missed it, I left GoGrid [recently](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/administrivia/my-gogrid-status) and am currently an independent Cloud Strategist. At the moment my client list is short, but impressive: 

  * [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) (#1 Virtualization system; working with their new Cloud business unit)
  * GoGrid / ServePath (#2 or #3 IaaS provider in U.S. depending on how you count)
  * [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com) (#1 Ruby on Rails PaaS provider)
  * [Cloud Central](http://www.cloudcentral.com.au) (first IaaS provider in Australia; pre-launch)

[1] That's a mouthful.  Not sure what's wrong with 'public' or 'external' infrastructure cloud.
