# EngineYard uses Chef, a Puppet Alternative

Last week two pretty interesting things happened in cloud land. The first was the release by [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) of [Chef](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home) a new open source alternative to [Puppet](http://puppet.reductivelabs.com). Both are terrific tools for configuration management setting the bar progressively higher in an area that has been woefully neglected by open source software. In addition, [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com) branched out from managing their own infrastructure to providing their deep expertise of Ruby on Rails/Merb in the form of [EY Solo](http://www.engineyard.com/solo) for AWS. This is the best practices all bundled up in a cloud instance and available for your immediate use. More importantly, EngineYard is one of the first consumers and [users of Chef](http://brainspl.at/articles/2009/01/15/chef-suck-on-my-chocolate-salty-balls) showing that it's already an interesting and viable alternative to Puppet. Recently, [Adam Jacob](http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamjacob), Opscode CTO, did a podcast [interview](http://media.libsyn.com/media/botchagalupe/cafe31.mp3) (MP3) with [John M. Willis](http://johnmwillis.com/), one of my favorite cloud bloggers. You can find the transcript [here](http://blog.opscode.com/2009/01/transcript-from-cloud-cafe-episode-31-opscode-introduces-chef.html). Just to be clear, I don't have a favorite. Both Chef and Puppet are great tools and I continue to be excited by what looks like a potential renaissance in open source tools for Internet operators and a resurgence in interest in pushing that discipline forward. You can see this even with conferences like [Velocity](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009), a new conference focused on Internet operations, that is going into it's second year. Congrats to both EngineYard and Chef!

**[James Turnbull](#64 "2009-01-23 01:46:02"):** Great post. I too look forward to seeing where it all ends up.

**[Bitfield Consulting](#65 "2010-01-13 05:19:02"):** I'm excited to see growth in this space. In fact, I'm surprised there are only two real contenders for the configuration management tool of choice. I've written a detailed comparison of Puppet and Chef in my article [Puppet vs Chef](http://bitfieldconsulting.com/puppet-vs-chef) and come to the conclusion that, for the time being, Puppet is still the market leader.

**[canadian pharmacy](#66 "2010-07-18 22:33:59"):** The internet is a wonderful tool. It can be used for research, for entertainment, and to make money. Many recently unemployed people have opened their eyes and their minds to how to make money using the internet. The truth is, it's really not that difficult if you know how to go about doing it.
