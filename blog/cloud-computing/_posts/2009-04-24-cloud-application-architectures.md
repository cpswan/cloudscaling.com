# Cloud Application Architectures

![Cloud Application Architectures by George Reese](http://neotactics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cloud-application-architectures.jpg) [George Reese](http://twitter.com/GeorgeReese)'s new book, [Cloud Application Architectures](http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Application-Architectures-Applications-Infrastructure/dp/0596156367), is finally out.  I'm probably biased, but I think it's pretty good as a handbook for building web applications on Amazon's EC2. I contributed an appendix that describes GoGrid and it's differences to EC2.  There is also a good [interview](http://www.cloudave.com/link/an-interview-with-george-reese-about-his-new-cloud-computing-book) on CloudAve with George Reese on the book. Highly recommended as a reference manual.

**[skillung](#89 "2009-08-20 11:09:01"):** I ordered the book today because I'm interested in those techiques behind the amazon services. The compliance requirements are not easy to fullfill. Let's hope this book has some good ideas.
