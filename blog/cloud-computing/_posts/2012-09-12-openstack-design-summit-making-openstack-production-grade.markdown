As many of you know the OpenStack Design Summit for Grizzly, the next release in spring 2013 is only a handful of weeks away.  Cloudscaling and some of our friends have submitted a number of fresh talks mostly centered around making OpenStack production-grade.  We would love to have your votes for our submissions and those of folks affiliated with us in some way.  Following is a list of recommended submissions and a short blurb on why you should care.

Cloudscaler Presentations:



	
  * [Putting Trust in OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#252): Cloudscaling is leading the charge on hardening OpenStack internals with our [trusted-messaging](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/trusted-messaging) blueprint that adds encryption and signing to all of the Nova RPC mechanisms including ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, and Qpid.  VOTE for Eric Windisch to explain how the trusted-messaging system will work and how you can increase the quality of security in your OpenStack deployments.

	
  * [Service Resiliency Doesn't Always Mean "HA" or "Cluster"](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#261): Putting pairs of failover HA servers everywhere isn't how Google and Amazon design for production-grade.  VOTE to find out about alternative high availability patterns that are scale-out in nature, not scale-up.

	
  * [Pimp My Cloud: Nova Configuration Hints and Tricks](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#179): There are 500+ configuration options and Cloudscaling has used most of them in over 10 different OpenStack deployments in the past 2 years.  VOTE to find out from Joe Gordon how to optimize your OpenStack cloud!

	
  * [Fighting for the Users](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#145): No one knows more about running OpenStack than Matt Joyce, who ran the original NASA OpenStack deployment and is a key team member of Cloudscaling's operations team.  Matt wants you to know what it means to fight for the users and operators.  VOTE to get a brain dump from an expert at running OpenStack in real life.

	
  * [Profiling the Nova Scheduler, a Case Study](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#180): Sometimes the internals of Nova can be a mystery.  Walk through a real life use case that identifies bottlenecks in performance of Nova and it's scheduling system.


Friends of the family presentations:

	
  * [Making clouds go faster, for fun and profit!](http://https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#281): Alex Howells, Sr. Operations Engineer at LivingSocial will explain how he profiled their new OpenStack-based cloud, where he found areas for performance optimization, and what can be done to make your OpenStack deployments sing.

	
  * [Cisco Webex Case Study](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/#280): Our friends at Mirantis helped Cisco Webex successfully build a production system based on OpenStack.  Don't you want to know how they did it?


And of course, you can see the entire list [here](http://www.mirantis.com/blog/you-can-help-get-large-enterprise-cloud-on-the-openstack-agenda/).  You will need to be a member of the OpenStack community in order to vote, but anyone can [join and contribute](http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute).

Vote NOW as the polls close this Friday the 14th!
