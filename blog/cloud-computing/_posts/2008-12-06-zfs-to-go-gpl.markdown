Word on the street is that Sun is exploring the option of going GPL at the [CEO](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/) level.  They have been chatting with customer council(s) about whether they should do this.

The answer is simple:  _Do it.  Do it now._

ZFS has inspired many.  There are a number of up and coming new filesystem and large scale storage solutions being developed under the GPL like [Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs), [Tux3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux3), and [Ceph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph) that all have similar characteristics to ZFS.

If you don't GPL it now, you'll lose the opportunity to make the kind of difference you are trying to make.
