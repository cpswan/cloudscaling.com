# Cloud: Change Management & Cloud Operations

Our own [Andrew Shafer](http://stochasticresonance.wordpress.com/), killed it today at the [Velocity Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010).  His presentation is a must read for webops, devops, and those aspiring to build 100% uptime cloud services. It's hard for folks to internalize how things are changing in Internet-land, but I think you'll get closer through this presentation.  It's not the same-old, same-old any more. Cloud computing is the biggest change to how IT functions since the 1980s and the advent of the personal computer (and hence the rise of client-server/enterprise computing). Enjoy ... (and outstanding job, Andrew!)

It’s always hard to tell whether something is going to take off, especially with so much hype but the landing page looks cool! <http://www.servage.com/>. Have checked out their Twitter page (twitter.com/totalcloud)but seems they are waiting for the launch before tweeting their own news.....
