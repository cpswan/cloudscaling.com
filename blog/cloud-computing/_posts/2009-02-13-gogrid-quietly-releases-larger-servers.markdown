[We](http://www.gogrid.com) quietly released 4 & 8GB servers today.  There will be a press release early next week.  Readers of my blog get this early tidbit.  ;)

The [release](http://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/Release_Log) includes 4GB 64-bit servers with 3 CPU cores for Linux and Windows via the UI and API.  8GB 64-bit servers with 6 CPU cores are also available, but only via the API.  The reasoning behind this was due to a [known issue](http://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/Errata) with the 8GB Windows instances.  We chose to release with the issue rather than delay.  We're working on a fix, but currently have no ETA.

I'm personally very excited to see us round out our product offering pretty significantly.  We had a small hole in the middle between 2GB virtual servers and [Cloud Connect](http://www.gogrid.com/how-it-works/cloud-connect.php) dedicated servers.  Now that gap is filled and there are more reasons than ever to be excited about GoGrid's particular product lineup.
