Great [new work](http://nutrun.com/weblog/rubyworks-production-stack-on-amazon-ec2/) from NutRun.

If you need to get a single system up and running [Ruby-on-Rails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) quickly on EC2, this is definitely the way to go.

Of course, if you need a full production cluster with a clustered database and all of the trimmings, the best options are [CloudScale Networks](http://www.cloudscale.net) or [RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com).
