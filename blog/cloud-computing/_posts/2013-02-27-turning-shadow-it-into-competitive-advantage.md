# Turning Shadow IT Into Competitive Advantage

What if you could deploy public cloud capabilities behind the firewall and transform shadow IT from a governance headache into an IT innovation driver? 

That's the subject of a webinar that Cloudscaling and [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/) will deliver on March 7.     
Elastic cloud infrastructure delivers a practical solution to the challenges faced by both CIOs and line of business users in today's social-mobile-big-data world.

Matt Asay, writing for [Read Write Cloud](http://readwrite.com/2013/02/22/stalking-shadow-it-amazon-assembles-an-enterprise-cloud-army), cites research showing that 88% of the 300 IT professionals surveyed believe that some of their data hosted in the cloud could be lost, corrupted or accessed by unauthorized individuals. So, giving internal users the agility of elastic cloud with the security of on-premise infrastructure is critical.

On March 7, RedMonk Analyst Stephen O’Grady and Cloudscaling CEO Michael Grant will discuss what's driving shadow IT and how to harness it for competitive advantage. 

Join this one hour webinar to gain insight into: 

  * __The business and technical drivers behind shadow IT __
  * __Strategies and approaches to transform shadow IT into managed innovation__
  * ____What Cloudscaling's elastic cloud infrastructure can do for your business ____
