Great time at the OpSource SaaS Summit 2009 today where I made the case that cloud computing is green by virtue of the efficiencies it drives.  I think you'll find this an interesting presentation as some information on ServePath / GoGrid is revealed.  Nothing juicy I'm afraid, but nevertheless I'm sure some of you will get a kick out of it.

Enjoy.
