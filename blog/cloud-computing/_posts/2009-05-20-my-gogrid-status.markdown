In the past few weeks, several opportunities (some almost too good to be true!) have been presented to me. I sat down with GoGrid’s CEO, John Keagy, to create a working relationship that would allow me to continue to support [GoGrid](http://www.gogrid.com), and give me the freedom to expand professionally.  GoGrid, and John, have been good to me.  Very good.We sat down and reframed our business relationship into a consultative one. I’m excited because this because this will let me continue as a GoGrid champion while allowing me to explore new opportunities. 

Having been 'on the inside', I know that GoGrid leads this space with their technology and their commitment to be the world's #1 '[cloudcenter](http://blog.gogrid.com/2009/01/08/cloudcenters-are-datacenters-in-the-sky/)' (still one of my most widely read GoGrid blog posts).

**New Directions**
There are several exciting opportunities I'm pursuing.  Standby to learn more.  :)  I’m also exploring ways to work directly with cloud customers and cloud providers. My unique knowledge of cloud technology enables me to offer my expertise to those looking for new ways to exploit the cloud, 'onboard' to the cloud, or build their own cloud.

You can find out more in my one page consulting brief downloadable [here](http://neotactics-public.s3.amazonaws.com/randybias-cloud-consulting-services.pdf) or to the top right of my blog. 

More good news and blog posts coming your way soon.
