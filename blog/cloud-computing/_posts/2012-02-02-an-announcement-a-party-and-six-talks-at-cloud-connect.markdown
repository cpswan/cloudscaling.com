The week of February 13 is shaping up to be a milestone in the life of our company. There’s a lot going on, and we’d love for you to join us.

**Monday, February 13
**We’ve got a big announcement on tap related to the next stage of our growth as the leading provider of open cloud solutions to support next-generation applications. Get all the details on Monday.


Also on Monday, Randy Bias and David Bernstein will be lending their expertise to the [Carrier Cloud Forum](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/santaclara/cloud-computing-conference/carrier-cloud-forum.php) at Cloud Connect in Santa Clara. Randy and David will participate on panels featuring current cloud use cases and choosing cloud models that fit the unique requirements of carriers and service providers.


**Tuesday, February 14
**We know, it’s Valentine’s Day. But, before you go out on your date, come hear Randy talk about the love of Cloudscaling’s life: Open and Scalable Clouds. He’ll give his talk on the main stage of [David Linthicum’s Architecture track](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/santaclara/cloud-computing-conference/application-architecture-and-design.php). Randy will highlight the factors driving adoption of open clouds. He’ll examine the role open clouds play in supporting next-generation applications that leverage the power of web technologies, mobile computing and big data processing to drive new business initiatives. And you’ll still have time to pick up some candy and flowers afterwards.


**Wednesday, February 15
**Over in [Scott Bils’ Organizational Readiness track](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/santaclara/cloud-computing-conference/organizational-readiness.php), Cloudscaler Francesco Paola will give a lightening talk, sharing the stage with Simon Wardley, a Cloudscaling advisor and prolific writer on the topic of cloud disruption, both in terms of business models and organizational preparedness. Later in that same track, Cesco will join a panel discussing how to train for, hire, and incentivize IT professionals with the right cloud skills.


On Wednesday evening, we’re having a cocktail party to celebrate the big week. [Join us from 6:00 until 8:00 pm](http://e2.ma/message/zgvm/fpsu) in the Magnolia room at the Hyatt Santa Clara (attached to the Santa Clara Convention Center where Cloud Connect is taking place).  We’ll have food, drinks, music and conversation about open clouds and what we’re hearing at Cloud Connect. (Check out the [invitation](http://e2.ma/message/zgvm/fpsu) to get a sneak preview of our new branding.)

We’d like to thank our partner, Cloud Technology Partners ([cloudTP](http://www.cloudtp.com/)), for co-sponsoring the event with us. They’ve been an important team member on several projects with us, and we’re thrilled they’re joining us.


One more thing... we’re hearing that there might be an OpenStack event later that evening. If it comes through, we’ll be sure and let you know about that as well.
