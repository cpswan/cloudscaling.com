# Happy Holidays

Myself and the rest of the neoTactics and CloudScale crews are off for the rest of the holidays. We'll see you again early next year. As a parting gift, the CloudScale team [posted some pics](http://www.cloudscale.net/2007/12/22/xmas-sneak-a-peek) of the latest ALPHA UI for their automated EC2 Ruby-on-Rails stack. Great stuff. See you next year. \--Randy
