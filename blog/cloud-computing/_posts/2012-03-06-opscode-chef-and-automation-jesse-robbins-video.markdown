Reposting is not something we do often, but this was too good to pass up.

Jesse Robbins of Opscode gave an exceptional 20-minute keynote at [Cloud Connect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/santaclara/) last month. Check out [the video of his keynote on the Opscode blog](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/14/automate-all-the-things/).

Also, the short video embedded below is a good summary about Opscode Chef and cloud infrastructure automation.
