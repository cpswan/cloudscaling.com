Relax after VMWorld and come share Dos Equis with the OpenStackers.

We'll be discussing cloud, cloud, cloud and maybe dodgeball Thursday evening.

5PM-8PM Sept. 2nd
@ Tres Agaves Restaurant
130 Townsend Street
San Francisco, CA 94107
(Just a few blocks from Moscone)

Come out and meet people working on OpenStack. (We're interesting people and willing to talk about things besides cloud. Promise...)
