# Cloudscaling on Cloud Networking and Arista

We don't usually link to vendor material, but in this case, the material in question is a video with yours truly.  Not only that, it's not just any vendor, but Arista Networks, who have been an incredible change agent for cloud computing.  Most of the successful commodity clouds I am aware of that are being built are leveraging Arista heavily.  The latest numbers I've seen put them in the #2 position for top-of-rack 10Gig Ethernet switching, right behind Cisco. Don't worry, I talk very little about Arista in this video and far more about the philosophy behind building cloud networking. There are a couple of other interesting and related items you should also check out: 

  * Our excellent whitepaper on [network virtualization in clouds](/blog/cloud-computing/updated-iaas-builders-guide)
  * Don Clark's recent Wall Street Journal blog posting: [Arista, Brocade Open to Networking Apps](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/05/03/arista-brocade-open-to-networking-apps/)
A choice quote from Don's article: 

> “Your typical network engineer, if you say ‘programmable,’ they will freak out,” says Randy Bias, co-founder and chief technology officer of Cloudscaling, a San Francisco startup that helps company set up cloud-style data centers.

**[Chris Marino](#3037 "2011-05-04 11:58:00"):** Nice. Isn't it ironic that the world seems to have been turned upside down?? 'Flat L3' networks and 'complex L2' networks? Seemed that it used to be the other way around. IMHO, I think the reason networks are late to the multi-tenancy game is that, historically, the network is all about sharing (and is itself shared). Multi-tenancy is about not sharing. Network sharing, while 'not sharing' really only became important with the cloud.

**[randybias](#3038 "2011-05-04 12:28:00"):** One acronym: MPLS. ;)

**[sh0x](#3041 "2011-05-17 15:35:00"):** ..but can you do MPLS/VPNs or VPLS with Arista?

**[randybias](#3042 "2011-05-17 16:04:00"):** Why would you need to inside a Datacenter?
