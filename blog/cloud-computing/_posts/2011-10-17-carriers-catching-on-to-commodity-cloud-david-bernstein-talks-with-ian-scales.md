# Carriers Catching on to Commodity Cloud: David Bernstein Talks With Ian Scales

Cloudscaling’s David Bernstein spent some time earlier this week with Ian Scales of Telecom TV while in London to speak at an IEEE event. In the short segment, David and Ian explore the five key points that carriers and large service providers are beginning to figure when it comes to their cloud strategies: 

  1. Commodity Cloud is Winning. A growing list of carriers are beginning to realize that building with commodity-based hardware architectures is the only way to build large systems that are fault tolerant and cost efficient enough to be competitive with their non-carrier competitors.
  2. Simplicity Scales. Large, fast, simple systems produce reliable and cost-effective platforms. Complexity does not.
  3. Open Systems are Winning. The timing of Oracle’s public cloud launch compared to the sellout crowd in Boston for the OpenStack Summit is a perfect contrast that illustrates this. Proprietary systems are expensive and offer a questionable value proposition. Open source offers short-term risk to be sure, but a more promising future with limited lock-in and licensing overhead.
  4. Building at Web Scale Requires New Thinking. In large systems, hardware is going to fail, regardless of how expensive it is. What makes a big cloud reliable and scalable is software, not hardware. Carriers are realizing that they can leave behind their old, expensive, legacy infrastructure when they build web-scale commodity clouds. They get a more competitive cloud with lower capex that’s easier to operate and has less operational baggage.
  5. Carriers Have Big Advantages Over Google and AWS. Carriers have nearly limitless, cheap bandwidth. They have deep expertise in network architecture and operations. They own the wired and wireless broadband networks And, they can easily connect mobile and tablet apps to OSS/BSS systems that can help developers get paid and manage customer relationships.
