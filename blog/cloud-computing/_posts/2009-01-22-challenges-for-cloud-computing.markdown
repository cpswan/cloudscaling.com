I had a great time presenting on the challenges for cloud storage today at the SNIA Winter Symposium '09 event.  It was my first GoGrid-related presentation and it went very well.  A very technical audience though, so there is actually quite a bit of content that was given orally in addition to what is in the slides.

The presentation is below.  Love to hear any feedback or thoughts you have on it.
