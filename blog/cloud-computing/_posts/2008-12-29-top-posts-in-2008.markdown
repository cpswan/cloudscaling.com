Following is a list of my top 5 most read articles in 2008.  Most, but not all, are cloud computing related.

  1. [Storage, Storage, Storage](/blog/technology/storage-storage-storage)


  2. [Short-Sighted about Cloud Computing](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/short-sighted-about-cloud-computing)


  3. [What Happened to Vertebra?](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/what-happened-to-vertebra/)


  4. [Cloud Values](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/cloud-values/)


  5. [Amazon Competes Against RightScale](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/amazon-competes-against-rightscale/)


And a couple of my personal, but somewhat overlooked, faves were:
  1. [Virtualization is not 'The Answer' for Clouds](http://www.neotactics.com/blog/technology/virtualization-is-not-the-answer-for-clouds/)


  2. [Clouds are not Datacenters](http://www.neotactics.com/blog/uncategorized/clouds-are-not-datacenters/)


I've got one last wrap-up post coming up and then we're on to 2009!
