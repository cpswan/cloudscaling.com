# Cloud CodeRetreat

![chillax](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/chillax.jpeg) Cloudscaling and the great crew fromÂ [Cloudkick](https://www.cloudkick.com/) want you to come sharpen your cloud coding skills Saturday, Nov 6th, 2010. Yes, it's a Saturday. Yes, it's pretty much all day. Yes, it will be fun. Bring a laptop and the willingness to teach and learn from each other. This one will be all about Python. (the language of [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/)) We'll bring food. Please [RSVP](http://cloudcoderetreat.eventbrite.com/) Photo from: http://www.flickr.com/photos/titaniumdreads/83425927/
