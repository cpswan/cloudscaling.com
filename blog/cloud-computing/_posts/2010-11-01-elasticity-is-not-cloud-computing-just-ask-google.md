# Elasticity is NOT #Cloud Computing ... Just Ask Google

In my [keynote presentation](http://www.interop.com/newyork/2010/presentations/enterprise-cloud-summit.php) (free registration required to download) on Day 1 of the Enterprise Cloud Summit at Interop NYC last week some interesting comments followed up in person and [on twitter](http://twitter.com/acroll/status/27733665801).  I think one particular notion that surprised people was the assertion that elasticity, a property commonly associated with 'cloud' and 'cloud computing', wasn't a part of cloud computing, but rather a side effect. This really goes back to the definition problem with cloud computing.  I have alluded to this in the past; that the Cloudscaling definition is functionally different from many of the common definitions out there today, including the famous NIST definitions.  Why do we think about this differently and why does that mean that elasticity is overblown as a property of cloud computing? The rest of this post is an illustrated walk-through of our thinking.  Please click through (below).  **The Start of a Thought** As many of you know, I've been working in the cloud computing space and blogging about this area for a very long time.  When the definitional problems started, along with the bickering in mid-2008, I started thinking: _Are 'cloud' and 'cloud computing' the same?  Is there commonality between SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS that we're missing?  What did Salesforce.com/Force, Amazon EC2/Amazon.com, and Google/Google App Engine all have in common?_ The conclusion I came to was a sort of 'aha!' moment.  I realized that the large web operators had essentially built whole new ways of building IT.  Something that was fundamentally different to what went before.  I also realized that a big part of why the definition problems existed is because the change was so **massive** that it was affecting everything in IT, not just some part, like storage or application development. Finally, I also realized that the bottom layers of IT, particularly the most common ones used every where such as servers, storage, and networking, were being treated in a completely different way by Amazon, Google, and company.  These folks were not following the standard play book.  In some ways they **were** following the playbook with the layers above servers, storage, and networking.  For example, they used standard programming languages to build their applications, such as Python and Java.  These had not changed.  The applications being provided were the same as those before, like e-mail, search, and recommendation systems.  Storage, compute, and networks were very different, however as were the 'platform' layers directly above them that allowed 'pooling' of these resources (e.g. [GoogleFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoogleFS)). What really changed matters though is that many of these pioneers took a whole new approach to running the lower layers of IT: datacenter facilities, the infrastructure architecture, and the direct layer above physical resources that creates a common datacenter platform.  Something Google calls [warehouse computing](http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00193ED1V01Y200905CAC006&rct=j&sa=U&ei=LZLITIvwGcugOpD9jPAI&ved=0CBQQFjAA&q=warehouse+computing+google&usg=AFQjCNGEH52MUt_CIE5yAHm542ylUYLz_Q) (PDF), but we simply call "cloud computing." Public utility cloud providers exist because "warehouse" (cloud) computing is now possible at a massive scale for low cost.  _Commoditization begets utilitization._ Something pioneered not by enterprise vendors, but by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and the like. **Cloud Computing as a Continuum of IT Infrastructure** In [Nick Carr's](http://www.roughtype.com/) famous book, [Does IT Matter](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591394449/routyp-20), he argued eloquently, providing copious examples, that most business infrastructure goes through a fairly common cycle.  This cycle is well-understood and more of a force of nature than anything else.  What we are seeing now with cloud computing is nothing more than this cycle replayed again with information technology (IT), just like it has with electricity, roads/highways, banking, and telecommunications before it. Here is a diagram that illustrates the cycle. ![nick-carr-adoption-curve]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/10/nick-carr-adoption-curve-1024x581.png)

This cycle also maps directly to the three clear phases that we see with IT infrastructure:

![nick-carr-adoption-curve-color]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/10/nick-carr-adoption-curve-color-1024x501.png)I think this really says it all.  For us, cloud computing is a whole new way of delivering IT services, particularly at the infrastructure level that does not look anything like what has come before.  In the same way that Mainframe and Client-Server computing are very very different.

Another way to illustrate this is to look at the approaches that each of these take:

![mainframe-clientserver-cloud-evolution-blue-and-black]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/10/mainframe-clientserver-cloud-evolution-blue-and-black-1024x702.png)

I'm not going to go into this matrix in detail right now, but whether you disagree with aspects or not, I'm certain you can see the trend occurring in the diagram.  Cloud computing definitely appears to be an evolution of the way that we create IT.

**Elasticity As Side-Effect** Which brings me to the basic argument.  If the following are true about cloud computing: 

  * It is something new ...
  * ... developed by the giant web businesses in order to get to massive scale
  * ... and an evolution of how IT infrastructure is created

Then we have to look carefully at how and why an Amazon or Google did what they did.  The diagram I used to explain during my keynote:

![causation-results-side-effects-cloud-computing]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/10/causation-results-side-effects-cloud-computing1-1024x635.png)

Large Internet business needed scale, cost-efficiency, and agility to be competitive.  Google is 1 Million servers.  Amazon.com releases new code thousands of times per day.  Microsoft runs 2,000 physical servers per headcount.  Google runs 10,000 per headcount and aspires for 100,000.  Google and Amazon use little or no 'enterprise computing' solutions.

So what happened?  The causation resulted in high levels of automation, a [devops culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), use of standardized commodity hardware, a focus on homogeneity, etc.  The end result is a system that lends itself to being turned into a utility (aka '_utilitization_'.  Hence the arrival of public clouds.  One of the side-effects of using cloud computing techniques to build an IT infrastructure is that now those platforms or applications built on top of it can leverage the automation to get elasticity (benefit), pay-only-for-what-you-use with metering (benefit), and other autonomous functions (benefit).

## Comments

**[Gilad](#629 "2010-11-01 11:13:55"):** Interesting argument, and valid in many ways, though it does not completely cover what SalesForce did at the invention of SaaS. Do you think SaaS is part of cloud computing?  
  
Would appreciate your thoughts.

**[Walter Adamson](#632 "2010-11-02 22:51:29"):** I saw your comments re Bob Warfield's response, and posted the following over there: <http://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/28481/what-is-the-sound-of-one-cloud-thunderclapping>/  
  
"OK I see what Randy is driving at, I hope! To the supplier it is not elastic it is simply a bandwidth management and capacity management/utilization problem, over fixed assets or a "sunk cost". Unless they are in a grid to a 3rd party cloud provider. To the consumer it is elastic. To the provider it is about capital and risk management, and the consumer about economies and responsiveness, sort of...."

**[randybias](#633 "2010-11-02 22:58:52"):** Exactly.

**[randybias](#634 "2010-11-03 07:23:01"):** There are two parts to the answer. First, SFDC did not invent SaaS. What they did is reinvigorate the idea of software application development and delivery. Web applications existed before SFDC. Few were sold into the enterprise though. SFDC really 'solved' the business model problems: what is it? what does it cost? who will buy it?  
  
Second, no, I don't consider SaaS 'cloud computing', but I do consider it 'cloud'. Cloud is the ecosystem of capability that is connected via the Internet and epitomized in being delivered as a service instead of a tangible product. Think 'cyberspace'. 'Cloud computing' is a new way of building IT derived from the needs of new 'cloud' apps and services. That new way of delivering the underlying IT resulted largely from achieving a kind of scale that allows everyone on 'the cloud' to connect to a single system.  
  
Many will take umbrage that I don't think SaaS is 'cloud computing', but that is mostly because of a pathological need to be part of the hype cycle. What's new is new. Software application delivery over a network is neither new, nor particularly interesting. The business model that SaaS exposed is new and interesting. The particulars around 'cloud computing' however are both new and extremely interesting in that they have never been successful before.

**[Mike Kavis](#635 "2010-11-05 06:46:59"):** My company uses Amazon (IaaS) to build a retail platform (PaaS). Elasticity is something we have to design for given the tools that Amazon provides. So the "cloud" does not give me elasticity, yet I use the "cloud" to deliver it. However, my customers get elasticity when they sign up to use our solution. So if you ask our customers, they would say elasticity is what you get when you go to the "cloud". If you ask me, I would say you need to architect for elasticity. Not sure if this is relevant to your conversation but these are some thoughts that raced through my brain as I read your post. Good post,Randy!

**[Beaker (Christofer Hoff)](#636 "2010-11-22 13:24:23"):** Apologies to [@randybias](http://twitter.com/randybias) for missing this earlier: http://tinyurl.com/2arrtff < Elasticity and Cloud {computing} < side effects vs definition

**[dorothybm (dorothy)](#637 "2010-11-22 13:58:43"):** Cloud clarity RT [@Beaker](http://twitter.com/Beaker): http://tinyurl.com/2arrtff < Elasticity and Cloud {computing} < side effects vs definition

**[matthewsmall (Matthew Small)](#638 "2010-11-22 16:34:47"):** [@randybias](http://twitter.com/randybias) Interesting conclusion...but can be harder to sell than some of the side effects. http://bit.ly/akDMhv

**[Chris Swan](#639 "2010-11-22 19:14:00"):** Randy, what do you think of Kate Craig-Wood's observation that services like EC2 are 'plastic not elastic', meaning that you need to do stuff (either manually or with a 3rd party tool) to make things scale to the demands being placed on an app?

**[randybias](#640 "2010-11-22 19:23:00"):** It makes perfect sense to me. I think the challenge here is separating the functionality from the pixie dust. All too often vendors and cloud providers are selling the pixie dust. Is it more important that a cloud is magically 'elastic' or that you can be guaranteed to add new capacity at a certain usage rate *somewhere* using an API? I would say the latter. Where is the hue and cry for AWS to provide SLA guarantees for provisioning a new VM? That would make building elasticity into your app easier. Instead, the discussion is about elasticity pixie dust and 'auto-magical' scaling.

**[John Treadway](#642 "2010-11-22 20:02:00"):** Randy - Very well-reasoned post (as usual). I was with you right up to the end. I see your three causal factors in many enterprise clouds. I also see constraints that greenfield environments like Amazon or Google don't have (GRC - gov/risk/compliance, political dynamics etc.). More importantly, out of the back end of their specific versions of your middle tier they can achieve the side-effects of elasticity, metering, self-provisioning and auto-scaling. Not that they always do, but often they can get all 4 of these side-effects. I just generally don't agree with the statement that a private infrastructure cloud is not a cloud. But I need more space than a comment, so see http://bit.ly/dcGXG8 for the details.

**[randybias](#643 "2010-11-22 20:48:00"):** That's not my argument. If the private cloud looks like Goog/AMZN, then it's a cloud. That's my point.

**[Juan Suero](#3006 "2011-01-24 11:12:00"):** Cloud computing is innovations in Application Lifecycle Management and Service Oriented Infrastructure. Lets take Microsoft Azure for example. Your infrastructure and applications are now described by a connected set of XML documents and can be managed by REST and WS* based services. Whether those things are deployed by Microsoft or AT&T or by any ole company with the Azure Box installed it doesnt matter. These set of document are source controlable and 3rd party vendors can create an ecosytem around managing it all. Think about your current load balancer. What would you have to do to automatically provision intelligence to it. You probably have to log in and learn some command language specific to the vendor. You'd need classes that costs 1000s of dollars and the skillset could be scarce so you have to pay an engineer 1000s of dollars. If you start to grow as a company you need a way to keep track of it all. It could quickly become a mess with other similar type of devices. Your network engineer would own you. BUt with a standardized platform defined at this higher layer you could source control it, and keep track of the changes with some integrated toolset.

**[Juan Suero](#3010 "2011-01-28 15:34:00"):** Cloud Computing is not just elasticity or ondemand infrastructure.... Cloud computing is more than that. Think of Azure. An Azure application is defined on 2 levels. Physical Infrastructure and Application. Both layers are defined in XML. Why is this important? Many reason. XML is source controllable. XML is interpretable by many tools. These two facts will live to supercharge the application development lifecycle from architects to devs to support to testing to deployment. Its all about the Applications. Next there are REST APIs to manage this "mini datacenter" definition. An entire ecosystem can grow around talking to these APIs and giving different views of the XML and calling the REST API's. Microsoft has a nice edge because they have an integrated toolset around these things. The next thing about cloud computing is this... Azure is going to go to market with hardware vendors to sell Azure in a box to companies and service providers. Now your talking about a global fabric for application development and deployment end to end. VMWare has some similar evolving strategy with vCloud API. I think EC2 Elastic Beanstalk is coming with same type of strategy. Cloud computing to me is an evolution of ALM and Service Oriented Infrastrucutre. Cloud enables SOA because of the metering of utilization. Metering allows you to reason about the relative value of applications and helps with the governance aspect. CLoud implements many of the abilities of SOA.

**[Paul D](#3103 "2011-11-25 07:19:00"):** I guess I am pretty late to this party but... I completely agree with the main premise, that elasticity is a side effect. Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that "cloud computing" does not involve any real new technology but merely a new way of combining existing technology? This statement in your follow-up comment " 'Cloud computing' is a new way of building IT" really says it. It is combining distributed computing technology , high availability, inexpensive computing power, on-demand provisioning, and self service. This still meets your definition of "new" but only in the combination. All of the pieces existed in pretty much the same form before. It is, IMHO, an evolution.

**[randybias](#3104 "2011-11-25 14:38:00"):** I would say that's mostly accurate. My only clarification to it would be that some elements are 'new' or, at least, newly used/developed. For example, in recombining commodity hardware and storage components to make AWS S3, part of what makes the clever reuse of this hardware and storage at scale is new technology. In this case, Dynamo and the application of CAP theorem along with gossip protocols and smart replication schemes. None of this is particularly new, although the combination is new and the development of a working model for storage replication in this manner is new (Dynamo). So, perhaps it's more accurate to say it's a combination of new ways of building/operating the IT stack combined with old technologies and a liberal sprinkling of new code/technology as point solutions that enable this rethinking (e.g. Dynamo, Map/Reduce, etc).

**[Paul D](#3105 "2011-11-25 16:02:00"):** Thanks Randy, I will "buy" your definition, yet using "replication" is not "new". What would be "new" is to implement a file system that abstracted the write instruction to the fabric of the network and "wrote" "simultaneously" to multiple "instances" of the DB/filesystem and "recovering"/handling the unavailability of a "mirror" by ignoring the "error" and "resyncing" when the node was "connected" again. Thus relegating the current offering to an "evolutionary" status rather than a "revolutionary" one. What is "new" about using "comodity hardware"? Isn't it "evolutionary"? Is "the clever reuse of this hardware and storage at scale" truly "new technology"? Isn't your statement "None of this is particularly new" "proof" that this is evolutionary? Occam's Razor suggests that the evolution of the elements involved are more accurate than any "revolutionary" explaination. To be truly "revolutionary", it would need to refute CAP Theroem and implement write instructions in the fiber so the sudden "disappearance" of a node, even the originating node, did not prevent the write. "Gossip protocals" still require "replication". I still see most of "cloud computing" as reinvention and combination of existing technology and, therefore, evolutionary but accept your clarification. Best, Paul
