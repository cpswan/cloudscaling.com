Discovered, by happenstance, an interesting presentation by [VMware's](http://www.vmware.com) [Orran Krieger](http://twitter.com/okrieg) on [vCloud](http://www.vmware.com/solutions/cloud-computing/vcloud.html).  Really great information in here about VMware's perspective on cloud computing, their cloud trajectory, and the vCloud architecture.  This looks like a recent undiscovered gem for folks trying to understand VMware and their cloud computing plans.  It was only recently given by Orran at the [Stanford Computer Forum Annual 2009 Plenary Meeting](http://forum.stanford.edu/events/2009plenary.php).

The PDF presentation was publicly posted without any kind of copyright notice so I posted it on SlideShare.  Hopefully not an issue, but wanted to make sure this got wider circulation.  It's extremely interesting:
