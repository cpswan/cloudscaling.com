# Amazon Web Services vs. Google

Dave Winer [breaks it down](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/12/15/amazonRemovesTheDatabaseSc.html) on why AWS matters, asking why Google and Microsoft seem to be missing the boat. Of course, insiders are aware that Google is almost certainly going to launch MapReduce as a service, or similar, inside the next year. Still, the real news here, to me, is that Amazon is moving forward incredibly fast. In terms of playing to strengths, they seem to be in a tremendously powerful position, already offering: 

  * Flexible Payment Service (FPS)
  * Simple Storage Service (S3)
  * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
  * Simple Queuing Service (SQS)
  * Mechanical Turk
  * Alex Web Services
  * Simple DB (SDB)
That's a tremendous amount of catching up to do even if Google wanted to or was geared internally to produce a service beyond MapReduce. The train has left the station . . .
