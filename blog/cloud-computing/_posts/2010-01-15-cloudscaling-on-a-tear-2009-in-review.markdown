We're a little late in posting this due to the holidays, but I have some exciting stats to share with you.  In 2009 the Cloudscaling blog became one of the hottest destinations for cloud knowhow.  A big part of that success was our unique perspective on cloud computing.  We aren't a news aggregation site.  Instead we try and provide hard information on differentiated visions on what cloud is, how it can help, and what people are doing with it today.

In particular, a number of articles posted here last year were extremely widely read.  In fact, the #1 article had well over 10,000 pageviews and almost 9,000 unique visitors.  3,500 pageviews came in that first week of posting 09/27/09 - 10/03/09.  That's an average of 500 per day.

Here's a chart showing our blog traffic growth over 2009:

As you can see we had tremendous growth and we're expecting more in 2010.  Thanks for your readership and especially your comments.  We're looking forward to even more conversation this year.

Here's a list of our top ten blog posts in 2009 (in order of most read) if you want to go back and review.

It's worth pointing out that the Infrastructure-as-a-Service Builder's Guide made #9 in the list, but was posted on 12/19/09.  It made #9 in only 12 days time.  The actual white paper has been downloaded almost 1,000 times in less than one month.

Again, thanks so much for readership.

Best,
