We've been incommunicado because we've been nosedown working on our upcoming product, the Virtual Server Room (VSR).  Expect some fairly interesting announcements early next year.  I'll provide some teaser blog entries here in the next couple of weeks that give some more insight into the VSR.

In the meantime, for those of you who are Mac users, we wanted to point out that VMware has finally released their VMware Fusion BETA to the general public [here](http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/).  Should be fairly interesting to see how it compares to [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/), which we have been very happy users of.

Have a fantastic holiday!
