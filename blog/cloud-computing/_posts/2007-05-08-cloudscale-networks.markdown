Apologies for the radio silence.  We have been rapidly evolving the Virtual Server Room product over the past several months.  The result has been the decision to morph into a service that leverages [Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011) and to roll that service into a new company and organization, [CloudScale Networks](http://www.cloudscale.net).

You can find out more at the CloudScale website.  In the meantime, neoTactics will continue as an IT-focused consultancy.
