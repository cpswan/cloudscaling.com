I'm tremendously excited to announce that I'm joining the [GoGrid](http://www.gogrid.com) (the cloud computing division of [ServePath](http://www.servepath.com)) executive team as VP of Technology Strategy.  In this role I'll be providing the primary technology vision and direction of the company.  GoGrid, an organization that competes with [Amazon Web Services](http://www.amazonaws.com) (AWS), has transformed from a web-hosting company into an innovation and technology-driven business. They have an amazing ability to reinvent their business model and anticipate trends.

I had multiple reasons for this decision, including the economic climate, which made it difficult to launch my startup, [CloudScale](http://neotactics.com/cloudscale).  Most important, GoGrid's direction and culture are a good fit for me. There are exciting developments that I'm not at liberty to discuss, and I see a bright future for the company.  It's a great opportunity to dig deeper into the cloud computing space and leverage my unique [background and history](http://neotactics.com/about/randy-bias/) in infrastructure & cloud services.

Iâ€™m not going away. I will continue to blog here about cloud computing, infrastructure, and IT.

My consulting business, neoTactics, Inc., is being put on the backburner and CloudScale is  mostly shutdown at this point.  The main issue there is the status of the code, which we were considering open sourcing.  This is still a possibility, but it's unclear if we'll have the resources to get it done in a timely manner.

This is a very exciting opportunity to be contributing to the [cloud computing (r)evolution](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/cloud-evolution-or-revolution/) at GoGrid.
