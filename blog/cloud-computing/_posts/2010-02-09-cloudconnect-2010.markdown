If you're not aware of it, [CloudConnect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/) 2010 is coming up on March 15-18th in Santa Clara, CA.  Our team is running the [Cloud Migrations](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/cloud-computing-conference/migration-strategies.php) track and a special breakout session on building Private Clouds.  We managed to get some really great panelists for the Migrations track and we're going to move from talking about the high level business issues like 'how do I move to cloud?' to in-depth technical discussions.  In between, we'll showcase some real world cloud migration stories (two great use cases teed up right now!).  For the final panel we'll discuss how internal and external clouds are built if you're trying to understand "build vs. buy."  So, true to form with the rest of this blog there will be a good mix of both business and technical.

Hope you can join us.  You can use the code "CNJRCC06" to get a free expo pass or 40% off the entire event.  You can register [here](https://cloudconnectevent.reg.techweb.com/2010/Registrations).  We look forward to seeing you there.
