# Virtualization and Organization Sitting in a Tree …

Wow, virtualization, organization, and management of systems are not only on the rise, but continue to converge, as I thought they would. The [latest announcement](http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/prod_072407.html?Referring_site=Networkers2007PressKit&Position=PressRelease2&Event=Networkers2007) is Cisco's foray into managing and orchestrating network and datacenter resources. Not to mention [Opsware was acquired by HP](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2161695,00.asp) (a big backer of [virtualization](http://h20331.www2.hp.com/enterprise/cache/454414-0-0-0-121.aspx)) for a cool 1.6B, [XenSource acquired by Citrix](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2171251,00.asp) for $500M on $3M revenue, and of course the [stellar IPO](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201800183&subSection=All+Stories) of [VMware](http://www.vmware.com). All of this leads me to believe the timing on the startup I'm involved with, [CloudScale Networks](http://www.cloudscale.net) couldn't be better. I'm really looking forward to this new frontier. Virtualization and the requirement for finding new ways to manage more and more virtualized systems is going to have a _dramatic_ effect on the way we build and run operational infrastructure.
