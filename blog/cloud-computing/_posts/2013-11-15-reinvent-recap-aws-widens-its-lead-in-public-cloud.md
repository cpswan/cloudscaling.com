# re:Invent Recap: AWS Widens its Lead in Public Cloud

The second [AWS re:Invent](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/) user conference is wrapping up today in Las Vegas with a sold out attendance of 8,000 people. Major new features and announcements included:

  * [AWS CloudTrail](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/aws-cloudtrail-capture-aws-api-activity.html) logs API calls by account users and stores them in S3 to facilitate governance and compliance.

  * [AWS WorkSpaces](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/amazon-workspaces-desktop-computing-in-the-cloud.html) (of particular note to Citrix and VMware) delivers cloud-based VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure).

  * [Amazon AppStream](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/amazon-appstream-deliver-streaming-applications-from-the-cloud.html) allows developers to stream applications from the cloud (such as 3D games and interactive HD apps) so the end users don’t require high end hardware to enjoy compute intensive apps.

  * [Amazon Kenesis](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/amazon-kinesis-real-time-processing-of-streamed-data.html) supports real-time processing of streaming big data.

  * [New I2 Instance Types](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/coming-soon-the-i2-instance-type-high-io-performance-via-ssd.html) for high I/O performance via SSD.

  * [New C3 Instance Types](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/a-generation-of-ec2-instances-for-compute-intensive-workloads.html) for compute intensive workloads.

Cloudscaling has long held that AWS along with Google Compute Engine (which graduated from Beta [earlier this year](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240184359/Google-makes-IaaS-product-Google-Compute-Engine-generally-available)) are the winning public cloud service providers that are important to emulate for hybrid cloud application interoperability, and ongoing customer and analyst proof points are only reinforcing that position over time.

Gartner recently refreshed its [IaaS Magic Quadrant](http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1IMDMZ5&ct=130819&st=sb) and had to rescale the results to accommodate AWS’s leadership growth in the leader quadrant, with the increasingly high scores pushing other public cloud service providers into less desirable quadrants. Per Lydia Long, the Gartner analyst who published the report, “While we saw much stronger momentum for AWS than other providers in 2012, 2013 has really been a tipping point. We still hear plenty of interest in competitors, but AWS is overwhelmingly the dominant vendor.” Google Compute Engine was not included in this quadrant refresh as it was still in Beta earlier in the year, but Lydia [lists Google among Amazon, Microsoft and VMware](http://blogs.gartner.com/lydia_leong/2013/09/05/where-are-the-challengers-to-aws/) as the vendors with leading market share five years from now.

AWS and other public cloud service providers regularly advocate that public cloud is – at least in the long term – the only viable solution for most, if not all, enterprise use cases. Cloudscaling, however, is built on the idea that there will always be critical drivers such as cost and control in enterprise IT that make a hybrid cloud strategy the only logical path forward for the enterprise CIO. Some problems are best addressed with a combination of owned and rented infrastructure.

The OpenStack ecosystem has the greatest opportunity for success in delivering on-premise, elastic private clouds for enterprises and scalable application companies. Cloudscaling’s product, Open Cloud System, delivers the only production-proven elastic cloud that’s ready for hybrid applications with AWS and GCE.

Cloudscaling invests significant engineering resources creating an elastic private cloud solution that offers both API and behavioral fidelity with the leading public clouds to enable hybrid cloud application interoperability. If you’re interested to see what’s possible in context of your use cases and application workloads, we invite you to contact us and [try out our hosted OCSgo elastic cloud implementation](http://go.cloudscaling.com/ocsgo-freetrial).
