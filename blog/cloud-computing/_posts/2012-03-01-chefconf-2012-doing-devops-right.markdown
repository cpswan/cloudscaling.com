Automation is one of the more tricky disciplines.  If it were as easy as it looks, then we would have had cloud years ago.  In recent years the [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) movement as striven to take automation to the next level.  One of the primary shakers and movers IMHO is the [OpsCode](http://www.opscode.com) team who's Chef open source project, while taking cues from Puppet, has moved the ball forward in significant ways.  A lot of this is because they have an incredible team of folks with large-scale and next-gen cloud automation experience such as [Chris Brown](http://twitter.com/skeptomai), [Jesse Robbins](http://twitter.com/jesserobbins), and [Adam Jacobs](http://twitter.com/adamhjk).

Much of the OpsCode team will be at their upcoming Chef conference, named, appropriately enough just [#ChefConf](http://chefconf.opscode.com/).  Come learn from the best, share your experiences with Chef, or even sponsor the conference.  I think you will find it's well worth your time. We have a number of Cloudscalers attending.  The early bird price is at a 30% discount  until March 31st!
