We're at [StartupCamp](http://www.startupcamp.org) for the next couple of days showing the Virtual Server Room (VSR) product, getting ideas and feedback from our target audience.  StartupCamp is highly recommended if you're looking for new ideas, partners, or general cross-pollination.

If you are one of the folks who came by for my presentation during the [SpeedGeeking contest](http://wiki.startupcamp.org/wiki/SpeedGeeking) today and are looking for more information, please feel free to contact me directly:  USER@neotactics.com, where USER is 'randyb'.  Love to hear from you whether as a partner, beta customer, or just to chat.

The neoTactics Virtual Server Room (VSR) is currently in alpha and we'll be taking beta customers in early December.  A full launch is planned for Q1 2007.
