Myself and the rest of the neoTactics and CloudScale crews are off for the rest of the holidays.  We'll see you again early next year.

As a parting gift, the CloudScale team [posted some pics](http://www.cloudscale.net/2007/12/22/xmas-sneak-a-peek) of the latest ALPHA UI for their automated EC2 Ruby-on-Rails stack.

Great stuff.  See you next year.
