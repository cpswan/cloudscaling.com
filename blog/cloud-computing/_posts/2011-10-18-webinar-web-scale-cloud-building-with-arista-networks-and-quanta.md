# Webinar: Web-Scale Cloud Building with Arista Networks and Quanta

We spend a lot of time on stage at conferences talking about building web-scale clouds. This Friday, we’re partnering with Quanta and Arista to deliver a webinar for engineers and anyone else wanting to dig deeper into the details of architecture, equipment selection, and other technical issues that are sometimes ignored in similar presentations. We’ll also spend some time talking about successful cloud business models based on these design approaches. Here’s the info: 

Friday, 21 October 2011 10:00 am PDT Duration: 1 hour [Register here](https://aristanetworksevents.webex.com/mw0306ld/mywebex/default.do?nomenu=true&siteurl=aristanetworksevents&service=6&rnd=0.5748179257850958&main_url=https%3A%2F%2Faristanetworksevents.webex.com%2Fec0605ld%2Feventcenter%2Fevent%2FeventAction.do%3FtheAction%3Ddetail%26confViewID%3D279995265%26siteurl%3Daristanetworksevents%26%26%26)

Enterprise technology providers have been positioning their solutions for public and private clouds with meager results, it is fundamentally impossible to build profitable cloud services when paying the enterprise computing, storage, and virtualization taxes to companies whose business model does not support the operation of profitable cloud services. Arista has partnered to deliver several successful clouds to market - this session will go in depth into the architectures and equipment selected, how to cost effectively scale the operation, mistakes to avoid, and discuss successful business models for transformation into a cloud provider.

Spread the word to anyone that wants to learn about building web-scale clouds from folks who’ve done it. **November 1, 2011 UPDATE**: Below is a replay of the webinar.
