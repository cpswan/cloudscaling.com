# More on Cloud Services

I just found an interesting PowerPoint presentation on Cloud Services from Forrester that seems pretty complete, especially as it relates to the enterprise. You can find it [here](http://www.forrester.com/rb/download?t=1&&c=nch&o=2128&ft=1) (PPT). Also, James Urquhart has a [nice wrap-up](http://blog.jamesurquhart.com/2008/05/it-just-keeps-getting-cloudier-and.html) of some of the recent discussion over 'cloud computing' terminology.
