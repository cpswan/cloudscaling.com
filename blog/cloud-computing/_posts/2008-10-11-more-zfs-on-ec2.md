# More ZFS on EC2

Looks like Don MacAskill discovered the joys of [MySQL on ZFS](http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/10/10/success-with-opensolaris-zfs-mysql-in-production/) running on OpenSolaris. This is great stuff. When we release Scaleen later this year as part of the [CloudScale Project](http://neotactics.com/cloudscale), it's going to make managing ZFS+EBS on EC2 trivial and fun.
