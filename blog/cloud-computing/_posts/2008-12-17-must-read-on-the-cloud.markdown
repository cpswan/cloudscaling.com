I don't often post simple links or even lists of interesting links.  I prefer to try and provide more infrequent, but original content.  I'm going to make an exception today because I want to point you to a really fantastic article by MasterMark:

[The Enterprise Cloud](http://jroller.com/MasterMark/entry/the_enterprise_cloud)

Fair warning, this is a very long blog entry, but it really touches on a number of different thoughts and memes that have been wandering through the cloud computing community's thinking for a while now.  In particular, I think there are some very cogent observations about what is 'the cloud' vs. 'cloud computing' and how the enterprise fits in.  As an added bonus you get a pretty deep dive into [VPN-Cubed](http://www.cohesiveft.com/vpncubed) from [CohesiveFT](http://www.cohesiveft.com/).

I consider this one a must read folks!
