Just in time for the New Year, we're releasing a short 12 page whitepaper on building Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds.  This whitepaper is targeted at folks building public or private clouds who want to understand our general take on clouds, cloud computing, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.  In particular, we highlight some of the important areas to think about when you are planning and designing your infrastructure cloud.

Of course, we welcome comments and feedback.  They will be incorporated into future revisions.  The paper itself does go into some technical depth in a few areas, but we can provide quite a bit more color in our [workshops](http://cloudscaling.com/services#3).

For your reading pleasure, I present our first big technical whitepaper:

Thanks!

Ps. We realize the definition of 'workload' or 'cloud workload' is not as crisp as it could be and request your feedback and thinking on better nomenclature or definitions.  Credit will be given as appropriate.
