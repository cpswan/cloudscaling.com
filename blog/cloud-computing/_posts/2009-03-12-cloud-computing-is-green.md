# Cloud Computing Is Green?

Great time at the OpSource SaaS Summit 2009 today where I made the case that cloud computing is green by virtue of the efficiencies it drives.  I think you'll find this an interesting presentation as some information on ServePath / GoGrid is revealed.  Nothing juicy I'm afraid, but nevertheless I'm sure some of you will get a kick out of it. Enjoy.

**[Mike Allen](#80 "2010-12-22 11:59:00"):** It's a real pity that companies have not used cloud computing to combat CO2 emissions. That would be perfectly feasible with choosing the right location for your servers (here's why that matters: http://www.fincloud.freehostingcloud.com/ ). It even makes economic sense to think twice of where your computing power is located.
