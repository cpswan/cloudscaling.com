Amazon Web Services just rolled out [new support services](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=566801011).  Very interesting.  Between this, the [new EC2 updates](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/ann.jspa?annID=295), and the [private beta for persistent storage](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=amazon+persistent+storage&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) there seem to be a lot of valuable AWS enhancements in the hopper of late.
