Last week two pretty interesting things happened in cloud land.  The first was the release by [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) of [Chef](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home) a new open source alternative to [Puppet](http://puppet.reductivelabs.com).  Both are terrific tools for configuration management setting the bar progressively higher in an area that has been woefully neglected by open source software.

In addition, [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com) branched out from managing their own infrastructure to providing their deep expertise of Ruby on Rails/Merb in the form of [EY Solo](http://www.engineyard.com/solo) for AWS.  This is the best practices all bundled up in a cloud instance and available for your immediate use.

More importantly, EngineYard is one of the first consumers and [users of Chef](http://brainspl.at/articles/2009/01/15/chef-suck-on-my-chocolate-salty-balls) showing that it's already an interesting and viable alternative to Puppet.

Recently, [Adam Jacob](http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamjacob), Opscode CTO, did a podcast [interview](http://media.libsyn.com/media/botchagalupe/cafe31.mp3) (MP3) with [John M. Willis](http://johnmwillis.com/), one of my favorite cloud bloggers.  You can find the transcript [here](http://blog.opscode.com/2009/01/transcript-from-cloud-cafe-episode-31-opscode-introduces-chef.html).

Just to be clear, I don't have a favorite.  Both Chef and Puppet are great tools and I continue to be excited by what looks like a potential renaissance in open source tools for Internet operators and a resurgence in interest in pushing that discipline forward.  You can see this even with conferences like [Velocity](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009), a new conference focused on Internet operations, that is going into it's second year.

Congrats to both EngineYard and Chef!
