# What Happened to Vertebra?

Earlier this year during the [2008 Velocity Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/content/home/) [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com) made some fairly [big waves](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=vertebra+%22engine+yard%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) (Google search) pre-announcing their open source cloud management tool, [Vertebra](http://www.slideshare.net/ezmobius/vertebra). This was of particular interest to me because of the [CloudScale Project](http://neotactics.com/cloudscale). We spent a considerable amount of time building a sysadmin messaging bus, but were never 100% happy with it. Vertebra looked like just the ticket, it would be open, and hopefully widely embraced, perhaps making our lives easier. At the time, the EngineYard (EY) folks promised 'right after summer'. With December literally right around the corner, you've got to wonder whether this vaporware will ever really show up. Given the [recent layoff](http://blog.engineyard.com/2008/11/17/rubinius-past-present-and-future) of the Rubinius team from EngineYard it seems logical to conclude that their management realizes that too many over-funded R&D; projects aren't necessarily going to be in the companies long term best interests. [Merb](http://merbivore.com/) made it out the gate thankfully, but will Vertebra? There hasn't been a single public release since it was pre-announced almost 6 months ago so I'm going to hazard a guess that we'll either never see it or at least not for a long time. Maybe Velocity Conference 2009?? Come on, EngineYard, just get it out there, warts and all. Either it will gather some more support and live or it won't.

**Update:** EY just released Vertebra today (2008/12/19). Find out more [here](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/followup-on-vertebra-posting/).

## Comments

**[Ezra Zygmuntowicz](#39 "2008-11-30 13:51:37"):** Relax, vertebra is being released on december 15th.

**[Jayson Vantuyl](#40 "2008-11-30 14:09:07"):** As the chief architect behind Vertebra, I can assure you that you'll see it sooner than you think--certainly sooner than Velocity 2009. Releasing a project and doing it well sometimes means letting the date slip more than just a little. Vertebra is the better for it and we've been getting some quality work done. We have an initial release date set and it's been holding firmly. Sorry I can't give you more details, but that's the best I can get approved at 6am on a Sunday. Keep a watch on the Engine Yard blog and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

**[Lachlan Donald](#41 "2008-11-30 23:10:46"):** Even just the jabber libraries would be nice. The state of jabber in the ruby world ain't great.

**[Dan Croak](#42 "2008-12-01 00:33:18"):** I believe it's called "Nanite" now. It's in beta now at EY, I believe. I think you have to ask them for access to it.

**[Tom Mornini](#43 "2008-12-01 06:03:22"):** Vertebra got a bit side tracked internally, but has seen steady progress internally over the last several months. We hear you loud and clear, and only ask for a bit more patience. A public release is absolutely coming.
