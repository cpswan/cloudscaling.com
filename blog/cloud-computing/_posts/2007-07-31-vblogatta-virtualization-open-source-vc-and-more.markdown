Lots to report on various fronts soon, but thought I would point to a [new blog](http://aleinwand.blogspot.com/) that I discovered by Allan Leinwand, one of the partners at [Panorama Capital](http://www.panoramacapital.com/).  Some great posts on [Vyatta](http://www.vyatta.com/), an open source IP router player.

Allan clearly knows his stuff and has some great perspectives.
