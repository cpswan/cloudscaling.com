# Cloud Standardization Like Internet Standardization?

One of my favorite and very opinionated folks is [Benjamin Black](http://blog.b3k.us/).  He just posted a [presentation](http://blog.b3k.us/internet_history_and_clouds.html) he gave last year that mirrors some of my earlier [thoughts](http://neotactics.com/blog/technology/cloud-hype-cloud-boom-cloud-bust) about the parallels between the advent and standardization of Internet+TCP/IP and Cloud Computing. On a related note George Reese has a well thought out [response](http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/03/cloud-varieties-of-openness-worth-wanting.html) to the earlier [brouhaha](http://blog.gogrid.com/2009/03/29/understanding-gogrid-and-cloud-standards/) around the [Open Cloud Manifesto](http://www.opencloudmanifesto.org) that was released while I was gone.

Ps. I'm back in the U.S. after an unexpected and extended overseas trip.  Expect a couple of posts this week. Pps. GoGrid position on Open Cloud Manifesto is [here](http://www.gogrid.com/open-cloud-manifesto/).
