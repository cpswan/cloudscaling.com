Our own [Andrew Shafer](http://stochasticresonance.wordpress.com/), killed it today at the [Velocity Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010).  His presentation is a must read for webops, devops, and those aspiring to build 100% uptime cloud services.

It's hard for folks to internalize how things are changing in Internet-land, but I think you'll get closer through this presentation.  It's not the same-old, same-old any more. Cloud computing is the biggest change to how IT functions since the 1980s and the advent of the personal computer (and hence the rise of client-server/enterprise computing).

Enjoy ... (and outstanding job, Andrew!)
