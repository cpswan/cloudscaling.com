# IaaS Builder's Guide - Network Edition

Long overdue, we’re pleased to announce the release of the next chapter of the [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Builder’s Guide](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/iaas-building-guide-v1.pdf). At the time we released the initial guide (December ‘09), there was very little information out there about building scalable and cost effective infrastructure clouds.  In particular, the level of documentation at an architectural level is still quite barren. Looking back now at the initial doc, it’s clearly grown long in the tooth (we’re working on a new revision!), but in the meantime we put some thought into a specific problem area: the network. This new technical whitepaper talks at an architectural level about building scalable networking for infrastructure clouds. Infrastructure clouds are complex and challenging engineering problems.  Covering the topic in detail would take years and several books. Meanwhile, the best practices and state-of-the-art proceeds apace. So, that being said, sharing these smaller technical pieces (~30 pages) that can go into some detail while remaining broad seems like a great way to share information and foment discussion. To that end, we present a follow on to the 2009 IaaS Builder’s Guide that focuses specifically on cloud datacenter networking and network virtualization: [download id="10" format="1"] Would love to hear your feedback.  We’ll be delivering more of these papers towards the end of the year and into 2012 to share more of our learning and experience. Thanks to our friends at NEC who sponsored the work on this paper, which enabled us to focus time and resources on this effort.

**[Hosted Desktop](#3021 "2011-03-23 04:22:00"):** Modern computing in the age of the Internet is quite a strange, remarkable thing. Cloud computing offers other benefits as well. Not too long ago, many of us worried about losing our documents, photos and files if something bad happened to our computers, like a virus or a hardware malfunction.

**[Lirong](#3027 "2011-04-12 20:38:00"):** Hi, Randy. Excellent job, and thank you very much. This white paper helps me a lot to understand the network virtualization in an cloud environment. From the perspective of an IaaS builder, besides L2 (switching) and L3 (routing) connectivity, the address configuration is also an important issue, including MAC addresses, public and private IP address assignments, especially the NAT tier for public and private IP addresses translation. Looking forward to such materials from Cloudscaling.
