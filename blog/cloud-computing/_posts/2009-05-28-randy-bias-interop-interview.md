# Randy Bias Interop Interview

Interview with the 'suave and intelligent  Randy Bias'  at 2009 Interop by [John M. Willis](http://www.johnmwillis.com/), who writes one of the more widely read cloud computing blogs and news sites.  Original post is [here](http://www.johnmwillis.com/cloud-computing/cloud-cafe-interop-2009-discussions-3/).  I've embedded the video below.  I think it went pretty well even though I was a bit exhausted. We briefly covered my thoughts on the general direction of infrastructure clouds: distribution, pooled resources, and virtualization across compute, storage, and network.  This is just a taste, but I've got several blog posts in the pipeline to do a deep dive on these topics and I think you will find them very, very educational.
