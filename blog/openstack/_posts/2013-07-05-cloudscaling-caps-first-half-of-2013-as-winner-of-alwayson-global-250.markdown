Earlier this week, Cloudscaling was [named as a winner](http://aonetwork.com/Announcing-the-2013-AlwaysOn-Global-250-Top-Private-Companies/) of an award given to companies with “game-changing approaches and technologies that are likely to disrupt existing markets and entrenched players in the Global Silicon Valley.”

Sales of private and hybrid cloud systems software to major reference customers are growing. Names like online gaming company [Ubisoft](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ubisoft-chooses-cloudscaling-open-cloud-system/), daily deal site [Living Social](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/livingsocial-chooses-open-cloud-system/), storage service EVault and others highlight the growth of our product, Open Cloud System (OCS), in production deployments.

Strategic partnerships with [Juniper Networks](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/juniper/) and [Seagate](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-and-seagate-partner-to-deliver-elastic-cloud-infrastructure-based-on-openstack-technology/), and a successful [Series B funding](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-closes-10-million-series-b-funding/) demonstrate the company’s positive momentum. We’ve announced [general availability of OCS 2.0](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-ships-open-cloud-system-v-2-0/), and we’ve unveiled plans for [OCS 2.5](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ocs25/), which will include a range of new features. And, we're recognized as a [top-10 code contributor](http://bitergia.com/public/reports/openstack/2013_04_grizzly/) to the OpenStack project that [we've publicly supported](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) since its launch July 2010.  

Cloudscaling was selected by the AlwaysOn editorial team and industry experts based on a set of five criteria during a three-month selection process:

  * innovation
  * market potential
  * commercialization
  * stakeholder value
  * media buzz

The AlwaysOn Global 250 winners were selected from a group of domestic and international technology companies nominated by investors, bankers, journalists and industry thought leaders.
