**SAN FRANCISCO, February 7, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the leading elastic cloud infrastructure software company, today released Open Cloud System (OCS) 2.0 for general availability in production deployments. 

The new version adds features that include OpenStack Folsom support and a new elastic block storage option. OCS Block Storage is a network attached disk solution that provides persistent, expandable and elastic block-level storage volumes. Volumes can be attached to a running instance and exposed as a device within the instance. Cloudscaling also developed an OCS Block Storage scheduler that maximizes volume dispersion on a per-tenant basis, which improves fault tolerance by reducing the impact of infrastructure failures on tenant volumes.  
  
“Enterprise organizations across industries, web application providers and service providers increasingly are asking for a private elastic cloud infrastructure solution to support new applications in order to modernize their infrastructure,” said Michael Grant, CEO of Cloudscaling. “As a production-grade elastic cloud solution, Open Cloud System is positioned to capitalize on this trend.”  
  
Cloudscaling customers include enterprises, web application providers and service providers. Sales activity has accelerated since the October unveiling of version 2.0, and [Cloudscaling recently expanded its executive team](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-expands-executive-team-as-market-interest-in-elastic-cloud-infrastructure-accelerates/) to address the ramp-up direct sales, channels, engineering and product management activity.  
  
"Technology such as Cloudscaling's Open Cloud System enables enterprise, service provider and webscale organizations to run their own on-premise elastic cloud infrastructure and manage it effectively by going beyond public cloud APIs," said Jay Lyman, 451 Research senior analyst. "These organizations are also seeking to leverage their existing investment and deployment in public clouds, highlighting the importance of hybrid cloud management capability that federates clouds such as Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine."  
  
Cloudscaling has built elastic cloud deployments for KT, Internap and others. The company was one of the founding community members and an [early, public supporter](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) of OpenStack. The company is a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation, and co-founder Randy Bias has served on the board since its formation. Cloudscaling is a top-ten code contributor, including ZeroMQ messaging, RPC abstraction layer, [APIs for Google Compute Engine](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-bringing-google-compute-engine-apis-to-openstack-project/) and security improvements.  
  
“General availability of OCS version 2.0 is a major milestone,” said Randy Bias, co-founder and CTO of Cloudscaling. “As far as we are aware, we’re the only company to ship an elastic cloud infrastructure software solution built on OpenStack technology for public or private deployments.”  
  
“The OpenStack community continues to grow, and more products based on the software are reaching the market at an accelerating pace," said Jonathan Bryce, executive director of the OpenStack Foundation. "Cloudscaling was an early supporter of OpenStack and is a strong contributor. The general availability of its OpenStack-powered OCS 2.0 underscores the project's momentum.”
