# Vote Now: Awesome Proposals for the Spring OpenStack Summit

Voting is now open for the [Spring 2014 OpenStack Summit](http://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/) in Atlanta!

Cloudscaling (and our friends at Mirantis) have submitted a variety of great session abstracts, from Randy Bias’ walkthrough of hybrid cloud landmines to avoid when architecting applications to Boris Renski’s discussion on updating the OpenStack mission statement to disrupt large player competitive barriers and keep the stack open for innovation.

Below, we’ve summarized each talk and provided a link to its page on the voting site. As always, you must be a member of the OpenStack Foundation to vote. If you’re not already a member, just [click here to join](https://www.openstack.org/join) as an individual member for free. You get to shape the OpenStack Summit agenda by voting up the sessions that you’d like to see.

We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta!

## **Cloudscaling Session Proposals**

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/open-cloud-system-3-0-openstack-architected-like-aws)) Open Cloud System 3.0: OpenStack Architected Like AWS (Azmir Mohamed)** - At Cloudscaling, we spend a great deal of effort operationalizing OpenStack for customers and ensuring it’s compatible with leading public clouds. In this session, we’ll detail the configuration and design decisions we make in real world OpenStack deployments.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/openstack-scale-out-high-availability-scaling-to-1-000-servers-without-neutron)) OpenStack Scale-out High Availability: Scaling to 1,000+ servers without Neutron (JC Smith + Randy Bias)** - The default OpenStack networking models don’t make sense in a modern datacenter. Similar to the approach taken by HP, CERN and other deployments, we’ll detail how we replace the default networking model through standard plugins in order to deploy a fully scale-out networking model that can support 100s of racks with incredibly high performance.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/for-cloud-operators-hands-on-with-openstack-for-elastic-clouds)) For Cloud Operators: Hands-on With OpenStack for Elastic Clouds (Sean Winn)** - In this session, we will provide a condensed version of our 2-day OpenStack Bootcamp workshop with an operator-centric, hands-on approach.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/zfs-on-linux-openstack-flash-performance-at-spinning-disk-prices)) ZFS on Linux + OpenStack: Flash Performance at Spinning Disk Prices (Joseph Glanville)** - Join us for this walkthrough of ZFS on Linux (ZoL) where we’ll cover the state of ZoL along with the related OpenStack plugins and drivers. You’ll leave with a clear understanding of why multi-tenant cloud workloads are perfect for ZFS as well as how to measure and tune performance.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/voice-of-the-user-running-openstack-in-production)) Voice of the User: Running OpenStack in Production (Drew Smith + [Ryan Lane](https://twitter.com/SquidDLane))** - Join us for an analysis and interactive discussion of real world OpenStack deployment issues. Along with guest speaker, Ryan Lane, who is running an OpenStack based cloud, we’re going to combine a review of data from our field and support requests with war story examples of “when it goes wrong”.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/openstack-block-storage-performance-vs-reliability)) OpenStack Block Storage: Performance vs. Reliability (Randy Bias + Joseph Glanville)** - In this presentation, we’ll talk about selecting and designing the right kind of storage for your use case. We’ll also walk you through how we built our block storage solution in Open Cloud System, its design principles, and explain why it is a better version of AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) in several key ways.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/iscsi-performance-testing-and-tuning)) iSCSI Performance Testing & Tuning (Joseph Glanville)** - In this session, we’ll explore the pros and cons of different iSCSI implementations within OpenStack Cinder deployments. We’ll then look at performance tuning options for iSCSI as well as the effects of related architecture components such as using jumbo frames in the network, flash storage, hybrid storage pools and iSCSI multi-pathing.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/emulating-a-large-scale-multi-rack-cloud-on-one-server)) Emulating A Large Scale, Multi-Rack Cloud on One Server (Mike Lang)** - In this presentation we’ll introduce a new open source tool that allows us to emulate a multi-rack, multi-server, OpenStack deployment on a single server, allowing complete cloud architectures to be tested. We’ll also recommend how this tool can be used to expand the OpenStack continuous integration system and possibly serve as a mechanism for testing a variety of OpenStack reference architectures within complex, multi-rack deployments.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/hybrid-cloud-landmines-architecting-apps-to-avoid-problems)) Hybrid Cloud Landmines: Architecting Apps to Avoid Problems (Drew Smith + Randy Bias)** - Application portability? Cross-cloud replication and bursting? These are hard issues with serious implications that we’ll examine in detail, digging into the subtleties between simply implementing a cross-cloud API and actually using it to get real work done. We’ll provide a set of recommendations on how to architect your application from the ground up to be hybrid cloud friendly.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/tinker-a-tool-for-network-configuration-management-at-cloud-scale)) Tinker: A Tool for Network Configuration Management at Cloud Scale (Abhishek Chanda)** - Managing network configuration in a cloud deployment can be a major pain. In this session, we will introduce tinker, a tool to generate and manage network device configuration using existing metadata to automatically and reliably generate configurations for all network devices in a cloud.

  * **([Vote Here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-atlanta/Presentation/openstack-and-the-google-compute-engine-apis)) OpenStack and the Google Compute Engine APIs (Alex Levine + Randy Bias)** - It’s a hybrid cloud world and OpenStack powered public clouds won’t be everywhere, so it makes sense that we have a rich ecosystem of compatibility APIs in addition to the native OpenStack APIs. Come learn about the Google Compute Engine (GCE) APIs we recently built and submitted back to StackForge, including how they were built, how to add them to your own OpenStack deployment, and how to test them.
