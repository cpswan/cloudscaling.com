SAN FRANCISCO, February 28, 2013 — Cloudscaling, the leading elastic cloud infrastructure software company, today announced that [IBS DataFort](http://www.datafort.org/) has selected the company’s Open Cloud System to build its public cloud service.

The first is a dev/test environment for internal use. The second is a production, public cloud environment supporting the company’s customers in the Russian Federation. Both clouds will offer object storage and compute initially, with OCS Block Storage to be added later.  
  
“The momentum we’re seeing is a direct reflection of the fact that customers want an elastic cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack technology,” said Michael Grant. “But they don’t want to build their own OpenStack-based cloud where they alone are responsible for maintenance and support. They want a production-grade product that’s supported by a community of users, and we’re the first company to deliver that with Open Cloud System.”  
  
Cloudscaling was one of the founding community members and an [early, public supporter](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) of OpenStack. The company is a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation, and co-founder Randy Bias has served on the board since its formation. Cloudscaling is a top-ten code contributor, including ZeroMQ messaging, RPC abstraction layer, [APIs for Google Compute Engine](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-bringing-google-compute-engine-apis-to-openstack-project/) and security improvements.
