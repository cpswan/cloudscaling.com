I am super excited to announce that EMC is sponsoring a DevOps event at EMC World 2015.  As many of you guessed, with the acquisition of Cloudscaling, and the recent creation of the EMC{code} initiative, we are trying to become a company that engages more directly with developers and the DevOps community in particular.

We have some great guests who are going to come and speak and some of the EMC{code} evangelists will be leading sessions as well.  Here's a list of the currently planned sessions:

  * Engaging the New Developer Paradigm
  * The DevOps Toolkit
  * The Enterprise Journey to DevOps
  * Docker 101
  * Container Management at Scale
  * Deploying Data-Centric APIs
  * Predictive Analytics to Prevent Fraud
  * Deploying Modern Apps with CloudFoundry

This will not be your normal EMC event and does not require registration for EMC World to attend.  So if you are in Las Vegas May 3rd, come join us!
