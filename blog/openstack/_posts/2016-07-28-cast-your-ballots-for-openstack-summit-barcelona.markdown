Ever wonder if EMC can bring the "wow"?  We are this time at OpenStack Summit in Barcelona.  I personally provided feedback and input into all of the EMC submissions this time around, helping increase the quality and the focus on solving problems and making OpenStack awesome instead of EMC products.  I think, if you spend the time looking through this list you will be impressed with what you see from our team!

Overall, the EMC team has submitted 25 speaking proposals. As youâ€™d expect, there are a few that deal with our contributions to the OpenStackâ€™s core storage technologies, but weâ€™re also offering useful tutorials and insights into networking, operations, Platform-as-a-Service (Paas), containers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and much more. There are even sessions that are perfect for OpenStack newcomers, as well as debunking persistent OpenStack myths.

There are 1,557 speaking proposals for Barcelona, a Summit record. Thatâ€™s even more impressive when you consider that an individual can be listed as a speaker in a maximum of three sessions. The diversity of speakers and topics on display at Summit is a testament to the communityâ€™s growth, diversity and global growth.

You can help decide which of these are selected for the ~300 available slots. First, youâ€™ll need to [register as an OpenStack community member](https://www.openstack.org/join/register/) (if youâ€™re not one already). There are a bunch of great sessions to browse through, sorted by category. Just go to [the Summit voting site](https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/vote-for-speakers/), login and follow the super-simple voting instructions.
