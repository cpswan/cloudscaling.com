tags:

As you are probably aware, voting is open for the OpenStack 2016 Spring Summit. It is incredibly difficult to go through the entire list of abstract submissions. I've gotten wind of some of the more interesting submissions from EMC, WalmartLabs, Mirantis, and others. Following is an incomplete list of talks that I think are worthwhile and deserving of your votes. Caveat emptor.

Please note that if you have something interesting, send it over and I'll take a look and add it to this list if it makes sense.

Following are the submissions and some commentary on them, roughly stack-ranked in my own order of interest.  Links go to the voting page should you find them of interest.

| *Deploying Persistent Storage for Containers with Heat* | Another badass Cloudscaler, Drew, is going to show-off EMC's open source project [REX-Ray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray), which provides an agnostic abstraction to connect containers to storage systems; great stuff | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/8409) |
| *Eliminating Novaâ€™s Storage Lock-in: A New Ephemeral Storage Architecture* | It is about time we shook up how Nova's ephemeral storage system works; this is a must have | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/8094) |
| *Cloud Operations at Scale* | This could be titled better, it's about @WalmartLabs cool open source multi-cloud app management PaaS, called [OneOps](http://www.oneops.com/); should be very good | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/6989) |
| *Lift and Shift* | More on [OneOps](http://www.oneops.com/) but with a focus on migrating legacy workloads to OpenStack clouds, which is crazy, but needed | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/7574) |

| *VMware NSX and Mirantis OpenStack integration* | Networking still a challenge in OpenStack, here's Mirantis on experiences with VMware NSX; probably useful | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/8576) |
| *Pros and cons of various OpenStack consumption models* | Might be OK; seems like this topic has been beaten to death though | [Vote Now!](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/8801) |
