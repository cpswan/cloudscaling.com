# A Concierge in the Cloud

Today at Interop in Las Vegas, Cloudscaling introduced our new Cloud Concierge Services. The idea for Cloud Concierge came about as we watched enterprises struggle to understand where to start implementing an OpenStack cloud solution. Between public clouds, private clouds and legacy technology, there were many interrelated and complex decisions companies have to make.

Cloud Concierge aims to reduce complexities and accelerate adoption of enterprise OpenStack cloud implementations. We achieve this by:

  * Building all-inclusive offerings catered to fixed budgets and timeframes,

  * Grouping the Cloud Concierge offerings in logical phases of OpenStack adoption,

  * Addressing the needs of key stakeholders in the enterprise, such as the infrastructure and application teams, who are transforming  IT.

More importantly, our Cloud Concierge Solution Architects will train IT professionals on new skills and guide them to insights needed to operate in a modern cloud era. In addition to getting the IT team started in the short-term, they’ll gain new learnings that will allow them to better serve their organizations for the long-term.

Adopting a cloud strategy is a must in today’s business world. An OpenStack decision will give companies greater agility, transform IT service delivery and create differentiated business value. Cloud Concierge will help you go from "Zero to Cloud" on time and on budget.
