If you are voting this year in the individual director elections, and I sincerely hope you are, I would appreciate it if you would give special consideration to the following candidates and a super brief "why"





	
  * [Kavit Munshi](http://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/139) - international and Indian representation

	
  * [Tim Bell](http://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/88) - user representative and continuity with user committee and user survey

	
  * [Jesse Proudman](http://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/12030) - operator representative and independent voice

	
  * [Haiying Wang](http://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/14611) - international and Chinese representation




There are many other fantastic candidates running including Monty Taylor, Rob Hirschfeld, Alex Freedland, Sean Winn, and Ken Hui. Â However, I decided to cut this down to a very short list that was stack ranked as follows:





	
  * International representation (we need more)

	
  * User representation (we need more)

	
  * Operator representation (we need more)




Good luck to everyone.
