# The Top Three Things To Bookmark for the Juno Summit

I can't believe that it’s less than a month before the the upcoming [Juno Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/).  As you start putting together your plans for the Summit, I wanted to highlight some items to look forward to from the Cloudscaling team.

**#1: Four Cloudscaling sessions have been selected for the Summit.**

We appreciate the explicit endorsement from the community - the topics reflect on our experience and leadership in the space - and we are very excited to share! Here is a recap of the four Cloudscaling sessions - you can simply add them to your Summit schedule by clicking on the links:

  * **[Hybrid Cloud Landmines: Architecting Apps to Avoid Problems (Randy Bias & Drew Smith): ](http://sched.co/1hWBuH8)**Application portability? Cross-cloud replication and bursting? These are hard issues with serious implications that we’ll examine in detail, digging into the subtleties between simply implementing a cross-cloud API and actually using it to get real work done. We’ll provide a set of recommendations on how to architect your application from the ground up to be hybrid cloud friendly.

  * **[Open Cloud System: OpenStack Architected Like AWS (Randy Bias): ](http://sched.co/1hWBuXC)**At Cloudscaling, we spend a great deal of effort operationalizing OpenStack for customers and ensuring it’s compatible with leading public clouds. In this session, we’ll detail the configuration and design decisions we make in real world OpenStack deployments.

  * **[OpenStack Scale-out High Availability: Scaling to 1,000+ servers without Neutron (Randy Bias, Abhishek Chandra & JC Smith)](http://sched.co/1hWz4rT)**: The default OpenStack networking models don’t make sense in a modern datacenter. Similar to the approach taken by HP, CERN and other deployments, we’ll detail how we replace the default networking model through standard plugins in order to deploy a fully scale-out networking model that can support 100s of racks with incredibly high performance.

  * <del>**[OpenStack Block Storage: Performance vs. Reliability (Randy Bias & Joseph Glanville)](http://sched.co/1lhHNKJ)**: In this presentation, we’ll talk about selecting and designing the right kind of storage for your use case. We’ll also walk you through how we built our block storage solution in Open Cloud System, its design principles, and explain why it is a better version of AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) in several key ways.</del> (I regret we have to pull the plug on this presentation due to time constraints!  Hopefully in fall.  Best, --Randy)

**#2: For the second Summit in a row, we are sharing our booth space with [Quanta](http://www.quantaqct.com/index.php?utm_campaign=General_QCT&utm_source=GoogleAdwords&utm_media=keywordsearch&utm_content=Link_to_homepage&gclid=CJq3qPSVrr0CFdKGfgodrlMA6w).**

The reason is simple - a significant majority of Cloudscaling customers use Quanta servers and storage equipment for their OpenStack powered clouds (and did I mentioned what such a great team they are to work with?). While OpenStack’s role is to ultimately abstract the underlying physical infrastructure, we have found Quanta hardware to be a perfect complement to elastic OpenStack-powered clouds. The Quanta team will be bringing a few racks of their datacenter products that are most optimized for building modern OpenStack clouds. Stop by our booth!

**#3:Open Cloud System (OCS) product announcement.**

OK, I know it’s a teaser. But it should be no surprise that [Icehouse](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Icehouse_Release_Schedule) will be central to the OCS announcement but we have a few additional items up our sleeves to share including

  * New OCS management capabilities

  * Additional AWS compatible features

So, it’s an understatement to say that we will be busy between now and the Summit. But any opportunity to meaningfully interact with the community, our customers and our partners is worth its weight in gold. We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta!
