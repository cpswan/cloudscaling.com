# Cloudscaling Closes Series A With Trinity Ventures

SAN FRANCISCO, October 3, 2011 -- Cloudscaling has closed a series A fundraising round with [Trinity Ventures](http://trinityventures.com). The round closed in mid-September, and funds have been used largely to expand the company’s software engineering team in support of the company’s transition from a consulting company to an open cloud solutions company, leveraging the fast-growing OpenStack open source project. Cloudscaling was an early supporter of and contributor to [OpenStack](http://openstack.org). To date, the company has designed and deployed large-scale open source and OpenStack clouds for several large clients, including KT and Internap. Cloudscaling has more production OpenStack experience than any other company. The investment from Trinity provided working capital for Cloudscaling to build a more complete software and services solution around OpenStack, one that is tailored to the unique needs of Cloudscaling’s core market of customers who want to support cloud-ready applications on their own infrastructure. “Cloudscaling has proven an atypical ability to deliver production scale open cloud systems on OpenStack,” said Fred Wang, partner with Trinity Ventures. “They are executing on a plan to leverage this work into a suite of products and services that should position them to target buyers of public and private open cloud systems that support cloud-ready applications at scale.” Michael Grant, Cloudscaling CEO, said, “Trinity understands our space. They also see the market opportunity of an open cloud offering built to address an emerging need in the market. Their engagement with Cloudscaling provided the resources to evolve from bespoke cloud builders to providers of a complete solution.” “We joined OpenStack in 2010 because we saw in it the promise of an open cloud ecosystem,” said Randy Bias, co-founder and CTO of Cloudscaling. “As more companies have joined the project, its momentum has become obvious. Our timing with both OpenStack and Trinity has been ideal, and we’re excited about the opportunity to deliver a complete open cloud solution.” **About Cloudscaling** [Cloudscaling](/) is the leading provider of open cloud infrastructure solutions for cloud-ready applications.
