# Cloudscaling Closes $10 Million Series B Funding

_**Trinity Ventures Joined by New Strategic Partners Juniper Networks and Seagate**_

**SAN FRANCISCO — May 22, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, has closed its Series B funding with [Trinity Ventures](http://www.trinityventures.com/) and two new investors, [Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/), through its Junos® Innovation Fund, and [Seagate](http://www.seagate.com/). The new round raised $10 million. 

In April, [Cloudscaling announced](http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130415-907175.html) Open Cloud System 2.5, the world’s most advanced OpenStack-powered cloud infrastructure system. At the same time, [Cloudscaling signaled](/blog/press-releases/juniper/) the first step of its partnership with Juniper through the integration of Juniper’s virtual network control (VNC) technology, JunosV Contrail, into Open Cloud System (OCS). OCS is a turnkey, OpenStack-powered cloud infrastructure system for enterprises, SaaS providers and cloud service providers. Cloudscaling and Juniper plan to continue delivering innovative, joint networking solutions that are open and standards-based to support elastic cloud services and a new generation of enterprise workloads.

Cloudscaling also joined the Seagate Cloud Builder Alliance Partner program [in April](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-and-seagate-partner-to-deliver-elastic-cloud-infrastructure-based-on-openstack-technology/). As part of the program, Cloudscaling and Seagate are focused on the development of optimized storage solutions for OpenStack-powered cloud infrastructure.

Since Q1 of this year, Cloudscaling has secured key customer wins with LivingSocial, EVault, Ubisoft and DataFort, launched a [channel partner program](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-elastic-cloud-partner-program-offers-channel-ready-solution-for-customers-implementing-openstack-powered-cloud-infrastructure/) and announced support for OpenStack Grizzly in the third generation of OCS technology, [Open Cloud System 2.5](http://www.cloudscaling.com/products/ocs-system-overview/).

**Supporting Quotes**

“This financing round caps a tremendous year of momentum for the company. That momentum affirms the voice of the market, clearly stating that customers want more than OpenStack. They want an on-premise, OpenStack-based private or public cloud turnkey system solution that delivers architectural and behavioral fidelity with major public clouds like Amazon Web Services. Our Open Cloud System product delivers on that need to enable hybrid cloud application deployments that span private and public cloud services.”

[Michael Grant](/blog/author/michaelgrant/), CEO — Cloudscaling

“Cloudscaling has executed on a vision of elastic cloud infrastructure as a turnkey solution that many agree with but few have delivered. The team has gained new customers and partners at an accelerating pace, highlighting their success at tapping an emerging, growing need among enterprise, SaaS and service provider segments.”

“Juniper Networks and Cloudscaling share a vision of how cloud infrastructure should be built and operated to support a new generation of cloud-aware workloads. Collaborating to integrate our technology into OCS was just the first step. We are excited to continue our work with Cloudscaling and support the company as a strategic investor.”

[Jeff Lipton](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/company/investments/team/), Vice President, Venture and Strategic Investments — Juniper Networks
