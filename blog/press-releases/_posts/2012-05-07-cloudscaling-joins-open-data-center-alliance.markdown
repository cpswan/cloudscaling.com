SAN FRANCISCO, May 7, 2012 — Cloudscaling has joined the more than 300 member companies of the[ Open Data Center Alliance](http://www.opendatacenteralliance.org/). The Alliance works to speed the migration to cloud computing by enabling the solution and service systems to address IT requirements with the highest level of interoperability and standards.

Cloudscaling joined the Alliance as a Contributor member and will participate with the Alliance’s[ Infrastructure Technical Workgroup](http://www.opendatacenteralliance.org/ourwork/technicalworkgroups) to further the development of[ usage models](http://www.opendatacenteralliance.org/ourwork/usagemodels) developed by the Alliance. Contributor members are selected and approved by the organization’s Steering Committee.

Participation in the ODCA contributes to Cloudscaling’s development of[ hardware blueprints](http://www.cloudscaling.com/solution/hardware-blueprints/). The blueprints comprise a layer of the recently announced Cloudscaling Open Cloud System (OCS) that defines production-grade server and networking combinations that deliver predictable technical and economic performance to meet specific design requirements. Blueprints show how to implement cloud resource block designs in physical hardware to meet design requirements for security, availability and subscription rates.

The Cloudscaling OCS is an infrastructure-as-a-service solution for cloud-ready applications. It offers the cost, performance and scalability benefits of Amazon Web Services for private or public clouds. In addition to hardware blueprints, the Cloudscaling OCS includes the Cloudscaling Open Cloud Operating System (OS). Based on OpenStack technology, the Cloudscaling Open Cloud OS leverages the company’s expertise designing and deploying production OpenStack clouds for clients such as KT (formerly Korea Telecom), Internap and others.

Beyond open hardware blueprints and open source software in the Open Cloud OS, other open components of the Cloudscaling OCS include open networking and open APIs.

“We’re thrilled to be a part of ODCA, because it has made impressive progress in a short period of time to define best practices and prototypical standards through the publication of its usage models,” said Caleb Tennis, Cloudscaling’s liaison to ODCA. “The combination of our experience designing, building and operating production-grade clouds for large clients with the experience and resource of the other 300-plus members means we can move the ball forward more quickly and get to the place where service providers and enterprises can make sound, facts-based decisions about cloud infrastructure deployment.”

“The success of the ODCA is based upon the contributions of members who have extensive cloud engineering and operations expertise,” said Jason Waxman, general manager in Intel’s Data Center and Connected Systems Group leading the Cloud Infrastructure Group (CIG). Intel serves as technical advisor to the Alliance. “With engineering talent combined with strong data center operations expertise and experience building production scale clouds for large organizations, Cloudscaling will strengthen the ODCA’s Infrastructure Technical Workgroup.”
