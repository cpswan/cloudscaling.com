# Taking Enterprise-Ready OpenStack for a Spin: Cloudscaling Launches OCSgo Evaluation Environment

### Demonstrations scheduled for OpenStack Summit in Hong Kong, next week.

**SAN FRANCISCO — November 1, 2013 —** Enterprise IT infrastructure professionals who want to get their hands on an OpenStack-powered cloud built in the architectural model of public clouds like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine (GCE) can now take one for a spin, before committing to a full deployment process.

Cloudscaling, the leading provider of elastic cloud infrastructure for private and hybrid clouds, today unveiled an evaluation environment of its Open Cloud System (OCS) elastic cloud software. Called [OCSgo](http://go.cloudscaling.com/ocsgo-freetrial), the evaluation environment is a fully configured implementation of OpenStack-powered OCS in a production environment. Enterprises interested in testing their apps on OCS can access OCSgo and conduct their own evaluations of the economic and operational benefits of running a private OpenStack-powered elastic cloud, or a hybrid cloud with either AWS or GCE. OCSgo delivers eight of the nine OpenStack projects in a fully functioning cloud environment.

“The best way to understand the power of a production-ready OpenStack private or hybrid cloud is to start using one,” said Azmir Mohamed, vice president of product management at Cloudscaling. “OCSgo lets our prospects and partners start experiencing the power of a fully functional OCS deployment in the time it takes to set up an account and complete an orientation.”

Demonstrations of OCSgo will be available at the [OpenStack Summit](http://www.openstack.org/summit/hk/), to be held next week in Hong Kong.

OCSgo lets users test drive all of the functionality available in the [latest release, OCS 2.5](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ocs-2-5-ga/). Users can spin up instances, attach and snapshot volumes and obtain IP addresses on demand using familiar tools such as Horizon, nova-client and euca2ools. They can load up their own applications to validate performance and discover the power of hybrid cloud on OCS by repatriating apps written for AWS. The evaluation environment also allows enterprises to learn about Cloudscaling OCS operator tools that help deploy and run an OpenStack-powered private cloud.

OCSgo runs on Quanta hardware in an Equinix data center equipped with AWS Direct Connect.

Enterprises can [sign up for OCSgo](http://go.cloudscaling.com/ocsgo-freetrial) via the OCSgo page on the Cloudscaling website.
