_San Francisco, CA - May 11, 2010 - _Cloudscaling today announced that Lew Tucker, former CTO of Sun's Cloud Computing business unit, has joined Cloudscaling's advisory board.  Cloudscaling CEO, Randy Bias, expanded on what this means to the company, “If you look at Lew’s history, you will see that he is a true visionary and always at the forefront of the next technology trend. His experiences at Salesforce.com, Sun Microsystems, and Thinking Machines, fit right alongside the deep expertise in cloud and distributed systems that makes Cloudscaling unique.”

Lew's background spans more than 20 years during which he has been instrumental in driving several major  technology changes, including: AI and massively parallel systems, developer adoption of Java, Salesforce.com's AppExchange,  and most recently, Cloud Computing.    According to Lew, “At Thinking Machines, in the early 1990's, we were building massively parallel machines using thousands of individual processors.   At Sun, we drove the evolution of the web with Java and networking, often using the tagline, 'The Network is the Computer'.   In this next phase, it’s becoming clear that the 'Cloud is the Computer'  and this promises to be just as disruptive.”

Cloudscaling CEO, Randy Bias, and Lew Tucker both share a long-term interest in the design and architecture of large, scalable systems.  As former VP Technology Strategy of GoGrid, Randy was responsible for building out one of the most complete infrastructure services in the cloud.  As CTO of Cloud Computing for Sun Microsystems, Lew was responsible for the architecture and API for Sun Cloud.

Lew's joining the advisory board continues to build up the Cloudscaling team's unique set of resources.  “If you want to build significant clouds, you have to have the right team.” said Randy Bias.  We’re the only cloud engineering services team I know of that can point to not one, but many, large scale cloud environments they have built.”
