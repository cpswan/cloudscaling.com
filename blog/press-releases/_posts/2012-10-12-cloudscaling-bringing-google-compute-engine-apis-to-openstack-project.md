# Cloudscaling Bringing Google Compute Engine APIs to OpenStack Project

SAN FRANCISCO, October 12, 2012 — Cloudscaling has joined the Google Cloud Technology Partner Program and will provide engineering and code development to implement the Google Compute Engine (GCE) application programming interfaces (APIs) for the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) project. Google Compute Engine APIs implemented by Cloudscaling for OpenStack will be offered back to the OpenStack Foundation as a candidate for inclusion in the project on October 15, in conjunction with the OpenStack Summit in San Diego. Since its launch in 2010, the OpenStack project has grown to include more than 5,600 individual members representing more than 850 organizations in 88 countries. The OpenStack Foundation has secured $10 million in funding from members and from 21 platinum and gold corporate sponsors. The OpenStack project now comprises more than 550,000 lines of code contributed by 573 developers. [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine) allows users to run large-scale computing workloads on Linux virtual machines hosted on Google's infrastructure. “The addition of Google Compute Engine’s API set to the OpenStack project will give OpenStack adopters greater flexibility and leverage as they map out their private and public cloud strategies,” said Randy Bias, co-founder and CTO of Cloudscaling. **About Cloudscaling ** [Cloudscaling](/) is the leading elastic cloud infrastructure company. Its Open Cloud System is the most reliable, scalable, and production-grade solution available for building elastic clouds powered by OpenStack technology. Cloudscaling is backed by [Trinity Ventures](http://www.trinityventures.com/) and is headquartered in San Francisco. ###
