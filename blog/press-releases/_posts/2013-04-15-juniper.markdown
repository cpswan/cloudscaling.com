			_**First Phase to Focus on Integration of Open Cloud System with Juniper’s Virtual Network Control Technology**_
		


		


			**PORTLAND, Ore. — April 15, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, and Juniper Networks, the industry leader in network innovation, today announced the first step in our partnership. Cloudscaling will deliver an elastic cloud infrastructure solution that combines the industry’s most advanced OpenStack cloud infrastructure system, Cloudscaling’s Open Cloud System, with Juniper’s virtual network control (VNC) technology, acquired through Contrail Systems, to provide advanced networking technology for enterprise and service provider customers. 
		


		


			The announcement was made at [OpenStack Summit](http://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/), held in Portland, Ore. this week.

At the same time, these customers need to preserve interoperability with existing IT investments that support current enterprise workloads. 
		


		


			“Juniper Networks is the industry leader in providing advanced networking solutions,” said Michael Grant, CEO of Cloudscaling. “Their combination of deep enterprise expertise and a formidable portfolio of SDN technologies makes them an ideal partner for delivering the most advanced OpenStack-powered cloud infrastructure system to both the enterprise and service provider markets.”
		


		


			Enterprises and service providers increasingly demand cloud infrastructure solutions that are open, scalable and elastic. These customers want clouds designed to support a new generation of cloud-aware workloads such as web/mobile applications, SaaS/PaaS deployments, and big data. 
		


		


			"The Juniper Networks and Cloudscaling teams have hit the ground running, and we are already working with early access customers who will benefit from the fruits of this partnership," said Ankur Singla, VP of SDN and cloud strategy at Juniper Networks. “Our customers want an OpenStack-based elastic cloud offering that meets stringent enterprise standards and this first step with Cloudscaling accelerates our OpenStack strategy by bringing our customers an exceptional OpenStack system, and will deliver Cloudscaling’s customers a proven VPC capability with native support for dynamic applications.”
		


		


			As a first phase of the work begins immediately, focused on integration of Juniper’s Contrail controller technology into Cloudscaling’s Open Cloud System. The result will be an open, any-to-any network fabric where Layer-3 network services are moved closer to cloud-enabled application workloads. This approach emulates the cloud infrastructure architectures pioneered by hyper-scale web and cloud computing pioneers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google.
		


		


			 Following validation with early access customers, general availability is slated for later this summer.
		


		


			The new software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities are implemented via OpenStack Quantum.  The VPC capability will be delivered as an advanced feature module in Open Cloud System 2.5, which was [announced today](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ocs25) at OpenStack Summit in Portland.
		


		


			“We’ve taken a deliberate approach to SDN,” said Randy Bias, co-founder and CTO of Cloudscaling. “Our customers expect production-ready solutions, and the work with Juniper reflects this effort. Juniper’s Contrail controller technology does more than simply emulate a Layer-2 network. It solves many of the problems inherent in other designs that compromise the dynamic scaling capabilities that app developers expect of a Layer-3 network. With the combination of VNC and Open Cloud System, customers get what they expect: architectural and behavioral compatibility between Layer-2 and Layer-3 topologies that support today’s enterprise apps and tomorrow’s hybrid deployments.”
