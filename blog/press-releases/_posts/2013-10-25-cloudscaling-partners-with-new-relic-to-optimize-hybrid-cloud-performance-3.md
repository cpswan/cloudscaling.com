# Cloudscaling Partners with New Relic to Optimize Hybrid Cloud Performance

### Partnership delivers app performance monitoring for OCS, AWS Hybrid Clouds.

**SAN FRANCISCO — October 25, 2013 —**Cloudscaling announced today a partnership with the software analytics company New Relic to provide real-time application performance monitoring on Cloudscaling’s Open Cloud System (OCS).

The New Relic service’s multi-tier capabilities enable customers to have a single view of their application performance in hybrid cloud environments, for example when OCS is the on-premise infrastructure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the public infrastructure. As a result, developers can now build applications with confidence, knowing that they can run in either or both environments with comparable, measurable performance.

The partnership is a key enabler in an emerging hybrid cloud trend, where enterprises and web application providers seek to leverage the agility and massive scale of public elastic clouds like AWS, while retaining the control of private cloud. Deploying a hybrid cloud with Open Cloud System running in the on-premise data center and AWS as the public cloud gives customers the best economics under a variety of scaling scenarios. The New Relic partnership lets them monitor critical application performance metrics, delivering a consistent end-user experience.

Under terms of the partnership, all Cloudscaling customers will receive [New Relic Standard free of charge](http://newrelic.com/cloudscaling). Services include availability monitoring, alerting and notification, as well as real-user and application response time, throughput and breakdown by layer. Performance data and analytics as well as API access are also provided.

"New Relic and Cloudscaling are expanding options for AWS users by giving them the ability to monitor application performance in both environments, AWS and Open Cloud System,” said Bill Lapcevic, vice president of business development at New Relic. “For customers building a hybrid cloud environment, that's critical, especially when workloads have hard requirements for performance and latency."

“The partnership with New Relic is a powerful example of how the ecosystem surrounding Open Cloud System is expanding,” said Adam Waters, COO and co-founder of Cloudscaling. “Customers want a community of tools and resources to deploy Open Cloud System in an ever-expanding set of production scenarios, and application monitoring is an essential piece of the puzzle. New Relic not only delivers that for our customers, they make it easy.”
