SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- KT, Korea's largest fixed-line operator and second largest mobile carrier, has launched the country's first large-scale private cloud with partner Cloudscaling.


                                                    
                                                    

KT plans to use cloud computing as a platform for providing a variety of data-intensive services to devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs as well as to deliver computing infrastructure internally to their enterprise. The private cloud is a milestone along this path.


                                                    
                                                    

KT evaluated a number of vendors and selected Cloudscaling when they realized that the two companies shared a common architectural philosophy based on commodity hardware, open source software, and aggressive automation.


                                                    
                                                    

"The leaders in cloud technology are Internet companies, not telcos or enterprise IT companies," said Jung-sik Suh, Senior Vice President, Cloud Services Business Unit at KT. "We wanted a cloud computing partner that understood our vision for cloud services, which is a cost-competitive offering at a high quality of service. Cloudscaling delivered what we were looking for."


                                                    
                                                    

"KT's approach to cloud computing is bold," said Randy Bias, CEO and founder of Cloudscaling. "Modeling their cloud computing architecture after the most efficient and lowest-cost public cloud providers should allow them to leapfrog regional competitors who are building clouds based on enterprise architectures."


                                                    
                                                    

The private cloud allows KT to skip altogether systems based on manual management of virtual servers and go directly to automated management. The first phase will consolidate 9,800 servers onto the new cloud infrastructure.

Cloudscaling partners with telcos and service providers to build and launch high-margin, revenue-generating cloud computing services such as computing and storage on demand. These services are designed for rapid deployment, quick return on investment, and choice with no lock-in. The Cloudscaling team brings together experience building and managing cloud infrastructures at companies such as KT, Amazon, GoGrid, Yahoo, Engine Yard, and Puppet Labs.
