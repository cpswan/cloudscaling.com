# Cloudscaling Builds Momentum with First Commercial OpenStack-Based Storage Cloud

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Cloudscaling's fourth large-scale deployment in the past nine months has launched, and it is the first commercial deployment of the OpenStack Swift object storage architecture outside of Rackspace.

Cloudscaling provided architecture, engineering and hardware specification support on the project for one of its Tier 1 ISP clients. The new object storage cloud offers virtually unlimited, petabyte-scale storage with rapid and automated scaling to serve thousands of new users.

The launch marks the fourth commercial-scale cloud deployment that Cloudscaling has supported in less than nine months. Other launches includes three separate open source commodity compute cloud projects for KT, the leading Korean telecom company.

Cloudscaling's success demonstrates that the open source philosophy behind projects like OpenStack and CloudStack has emerged as a key feature of competitive and scalable clouds. The launch of this new storage service shows that open source delivers cost-competitiveness for storage clouds (on-demand-file-storage) as well.

"This launch is the latest demonstration of the momentum building for clouds designed around commodity hardware and open source software," said Randy Bias, CEO and founder, of Cloudscaling. "This is the proven approach that results in clouds that make sense both technically and economically."

Stephen Spector, community manager for OpenStack observed, "Cloudscaling has taken a leadership role in our community by helping their clients successfully design and launch commercial-scale clouds built on open source."
