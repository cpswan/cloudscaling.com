 **SAN FRANCISCO — October 16, 2013 —** The rapid rise of OpenStack and practical advice on building hybrid elastic clouds are two themes being presented at a series of events scheduled this fall featuring Cloudscaling and partners.

Technical and engineering leaders at Cloudscaling, the leading provider of elastic cloud infrastructure, participate in more than 30 events each year. Thus far in 2013, events have included numerous webinars, meetups and industry events, including Cloud Connect, Interop, OpenStack Summit and others. An August Meetup attracted nearly 200 attendees and a [live broadcast by SiliconANGLE.tv](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7H5zFWUSVI) for a debate on the merits of embracing the AWS API set within the OpenStack community.
