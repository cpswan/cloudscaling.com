# Cloudscaling Expands Executive Team as Market Interest in Elastic Cloud Infrastructure Accelerates

**SAN FRANCISCO, January 30, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the leading elastic cloud infrastructure software company, today announced the addition of Andy Green as vice president, business and channel development.

The move caps a series of strategic additions to the company’s executive team in which leadership roles for engineering, enterprise sales, product management, and channel development have been set. Green’s priority is to expand the company’s channel sales infrastructure, a role he previously performed for Wyse, The Santa Cruz Operation, Sun Microsystems, Chordiant and CIC. Green also is the founder of PenData Solutions and most recently was with Catbird Networks.  
  
Green joins Pam Brodt, who recently joined to develop and lead the company’s direct sales organization as vice president, sales. Paul Guth continues to lead the company's software development, and has recently added the role of vice president, engineering. Azmir Mohamed, formerly of Cisco and VMware, has joined the company as senior director, product management.  
  
“With enterprises, web application companies and service providers searching for true elastic infrastructure solutions, we are seeing increasing prospect and sales activity surrounding our Open Cloud System,” said Michael Grant, CEO of Cloudscaling. “To support that growth we’ve made thoughtful additions to the leadership of our channels, engineering, enterprise sales and product management functions. Andy, Paul, Pam, and Azmir bring precisely the right mix of domain knowledge and business experience to take on those roles.”  
  
Cloudscaling announced version 2.0 of Open Cloud System at the OpenStack Summit in October 2012. It is the first production-grade elastic cloud infrastructure system that offers both API and performance fidelity with Amazon Web Services and soon, Google Compute Engine. Open Cloud System incorporates the OpenStack open source project, but adds critical production-grade features and a complete modular hardware reference architecture to ease deployment and scaling.

Prior to The Roundtable Network, Pam led a successful interim sales executive consulting practice, where she serially drove tech start-ups to their first enterprise revenues focused on early and mid-stage customer acquisition and team building.
