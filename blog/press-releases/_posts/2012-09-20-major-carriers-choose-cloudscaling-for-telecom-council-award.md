# Major Carriers Choose Cloudscaling for Telecom Council Award

SAN FRANCISCO, September 19, 2012 — More than 25 major telecommunications companies have selected Cloudscaling as the 2012 winner of an award given to startups bringing promising telecom technologies to market. A [SPIFFY Award](http://www.telecomcouncil.com/spiffys) was presented by the Service Provider Forum (SPIF) of the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley at the Council’s [TC3: Telecom Council Carrier Connections](http://www.telecomcouncil.com/tc3) Summit event in Sunnyvale, Calif. last week. Eight companies were honored in various categories at the event for innovation, execution, management and technologies. Cloudscaling was selected from among more than 200 startups to receive the Core Award for Best Fixed Telecom Opportunity. Eligibility for the SPIFFY Awards follows a rigorous screening process in which startups are evaluated by Telecom Council Steering Committees. Startups that clear the screening process then present to the SPIF, which comprises more than 25 major telecommunications companies that vote to select the SPIFFY Award winners. "Our product is appealing to carriers that want to deploy production-grade elastic public clouds on OpenStack technology,” said David Bernstein, vice president of carrier strategy for Cloudscaling. “Winning the SPIFFY is meaningful because communications services providers are one of our three market segments, and they’re the ones who saw value in what we’re doing and chose us for the award. We’re both grateful and humbled to receive this honor.” “The past year has been great for innovation in telecom,” said Liz Kerton, president of the Council. “Cloudscaling’s contributions to the ecosystem as a Council member, and their product and experience in the telecom space, made a memorable impact on the carriers in the SPIF who select our winners each year.”**** About Cloudscaling ****[Cloudscaling](/) is the leading elastic infrastructure cloud software and systems company.
