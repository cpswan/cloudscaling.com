# Building, Deploying, Leveraging AWS-Compatible Hybrid Clouds the Focus of Cloudscaling Fall Webinar Series

**Series Features Cost Analysis Tool Demonstrating Savings Available When Shifting to Hybrid From a Public-Only Cloud Strategy**

SAN FRANCISCO — September 11, 2013 — Web app providers and enterprises looking to build AWS-compatible hybrid clouds with OpenStack are invited to register for Cloudscaling’s  Fall 2013 webinar series titled, “Your Journey to a Hybrid Cloud.” Experts from leading cloud products and services organizations will provide insight and recommendations on how to design, build, deploy and leverage AWS-compatible hybrid clouds with OpenStack and Cloudscaling Open Cloud System (OCS).

Across industries, companies want to emulate AWS functionality in order to bring that productivity into the enterprise more securely, reliably and cost-effectively. The webinar series will show participants how to extend the AWS value proposition to a hybrid cloud strategy that  drives innovation and new efficiencies. Cloudscaling has been an open and vocal advocate for embracing the architectural lessons of AWS and Google, including providing for a low-level API in OpenStack supporting them.

The webinar series begins Thursday, September 12, 2013. Our first webinar will be held with Cloudscaling partner CumuLogic, and features Azmir Mohamed, VP of Product Management at Cloudscaling and Sandeep Patni, VP Services at CumuLogic. Azmir and Sandeep will discuss the hybrid cloud model and the strategic importance of technologies such as PaaS, DBaaS and OpenStack to provide a pragmatic path toward agile, self-service IT delivery.

The series will cover both technical and business topics, thought leadership from industry experts, use cases, customer stories and more. During the series, a cost-analysis tool will be demonstrated showing how organizations can calculate the cost savings potential of shifting from a public-only strategy to a hybrid strategy.
