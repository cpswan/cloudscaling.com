Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, has joined the Seagate Cloud Builder Alliance Partner program, and the two companies are working together to optimize joint solutions for the OpenStack environment.

In a show of support, the company will help cloud builders to develop more scalable, customizable solutions using open platforms while reducing operating costs and providing benefits for consumers in the marketplace.

Open Cloud System is Cloudscaling’s OpenStack-powered elastic cloud infrastructure software solution. It is the first production-grade solution for public and private elastic clouds based on OpenStack technology. Recently announced customers include IBS DataFort, LivingSocial and Ubisoft, each of which have selected Open Cloud System for production elastic cloud infrastructure.

“We’re actively engaged in joint channel activities with Cloudscaling as part of our Cloud Builder Alliance,” said Bob Griswold, Seagate’s senior vice president, product line management. “We share a similar vision of cloud computing that is scalable, agile, open and an economic game changer.”

Cloudscaling was [among the first commercial entities](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) to publicly support OpenStack and has product solutions incorporating the open source project in production environments for multiple customers. It was the first company to deploy a Nova compute public cloud and the first to deploy a Swift storage public cloud outside of Rackspace. The company is a founding member of the OpenStack Foundation and a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor. Co-founder and CTO Randy Bias has served on the Foundation board since its inception, and Cloudscaling is a top-ten code contributor to the project, including ZeroMQ messaging, RPC abstraction layer, [APIs for Google Compute Engine](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-bringing-google-compute-engine-apis-to-openstack-project/)and security improvements.

“Recent customer and partner momentum are proof points that the benefits delivered by Open Cloud System are striking a chord,” said Michael Grant, CEO of Cloudscaling. “Our relationship with Seagate is the latest example of that momentum, and we’ll leverage that advantage to further distance Cloudscaling from the rest of the field.”
