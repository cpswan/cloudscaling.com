# Ubisoft Chooses Cloudscaling Open Cloud System

**SAN FRANCISCO, April 10, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, today announced that [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/) has selected Open Cloud System for production deployment. The selection was made after an in-depth evaluation of OpenStack-based cloud infrastructure options.

![Ubisoft-Logo 200](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ubisoft-Logo-2001.png)Ubisoft joins a series of recently announced Open Cloud System customers including [LivingSocial](http://www.livingsocial.com/) and [IBS DataFort](http://www.datafort.org/). Open Cloud System is the first production-grade elastic cloud infrastructure software system based on OpenStack technology.

Cloudscaling was among the first commercial entities to [publicly support OpenStack](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) and has product solutions incorporating the open source project in production environments for multiple customers. It was the first company to deploy a Nova compute public cloud and the first to deploy a Swift storage public cloud outside of Rackspace. The company is a founding member of the OpenStack Foundation and a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor. Co-founder and CTO Randy Bias has served on the Foundation board since its inception, and Cloudscaling is a top-ten code contributor to the project, including ZeroMQ messaging, RPC abstraction layer, [APIs for Google Compute Engine](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-bringing-google-compute-engine-apis-to-openstack-project/) and security improvements.

“Our customer momentum is validation that the market is looking for an OpenStack-powered elastic cloud solution that is production grade,” said Michael Grant. “It’s great to have Ubisoft as a customer, as it shows that we’re on the right track when we compete head to head with other OpenStack options and win.”
