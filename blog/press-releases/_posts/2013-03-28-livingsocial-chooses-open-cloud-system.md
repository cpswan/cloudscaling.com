# LivingSocial Chooses Open Cloud System

SAN FRANCISCO, March 28, 2013 — Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, today announced that [LivingSocial](http://www.livingsocial.com/) is the most recent company to deploy Cloudscaling Open Cloud System as an elastic cloud infrastructure solution. The company joins IBS DataFort, which [in February announced](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10479427.htm) it would deploy Open Cloud System in two clouds serving its customers in the Russian Federation.

![livingsocial-logo-sq_0](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/livingsocial-logo-sq_0.png)Open Cloud System is the first private elastic cloud infrastructure software solution based on OpenStack technology. Cloudscaling [announced general availability of version 2.0](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-ships-open-cloud-system-v-2-0/), which adds features that include support for OpenStack Folsom and block storage.

Cloudscaling was among the first commercial entities to[ publicly support OpenStack](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) and has product solutions incorporating the open source project in production environments for multiple customers. It was the first company to deploy a Nova compute public cloud and the first to deploy a Swift storage public cloud outside of Rackspace. The company is a founding member of the OpenStack Foundation and a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor. Co-founder and CTO Randy Bias has served on the Foundation board since its inception, and Cloudscaling is a top-ten code contributor to the project, including ZeroMQ messaging, RPC abstraction layer,[ APIs for Google Compute Engine](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-bringing-google-compute-engine-apis-to-openstack-project/) and security improvements.

“Customers consistently tell us that they want an OpenStack-based solution that delivers high fidelity and compatibility with Amazon Web Services in a private solution,” said Michael Grant, CEO of Cloudscaling. “Open Cloud System delivers on that promise, and it’s gratifying to see the positive, accelerating prospect and customer response to our product.”
