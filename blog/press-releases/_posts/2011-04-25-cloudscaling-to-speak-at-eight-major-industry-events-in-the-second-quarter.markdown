SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2011 - The engineering and business leadership of Cloudscaling is scheduled to speak at eight major industry events in the next nine weeks.

"The content we're developing for these conferences touches on the meta-theme of disruption," said Randy Bias. "Cloud has fundamentally changed what consumers of IT services value and what they expect from service providers. As with any disruption, new entrants are making significant headway in eroding established markets. Our goal is to use these events as a forum to provide insights and direction on how services providers can understand the nature of the cloud disruption and seize it as an opportunity."


													

"Our sessions will cover topics as diverse as cloud strategies, governance, cloud vendor selection considerations for telecom carriers, devops, open source architectures, APIs, and a carrier case study."


													

Wherever possible, content from these conferences will be available via the Cloudscaling blog, at cloudscaling.com/blog immediately after the events.
