**SAN FRANCISCO, December 4, 2012 —** Cloudscaling, the leading elastic cloud infrastructure company, announced today that [Pam Brodt](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/author/pambrodt/) has joined Cloudscaling as vice president, sales. As part of the Cloudscaling management team, Brodt will have responsibility for expanding the company's sales efforts targeting enterprise and web application customers interested in deploying private elastic cloud infrastructure for new, dynamic applications.

Brodt will be responsible for building the company’s sales organization in response to growing demand for the company’s flagship product, Open Cloud System. Version 2.0 of the product was announced in October and is scheduled for availability later this month.  
  
Brodt brings more than 20 years of years of technology industry sales, marketing and entrepreneurial experience to Cloudscaling. In 2004, she founded [The Roundtable Network](http://www.theroundtablenetwork.com/), a successful lead-generation firm that matches information security vendors with C-level enterprise buyers in a face-to-face forum. As CEO of The Roundtable Network, she led the organization’s growth into a venue where roundtable seats were valued by Fortune 1000 executives by both vendors and buyers.  
  
Prior to The Roundtable Network, Brodt led a successful interim sales executive consulting practice where she serially drove tech start-ups to their first enterprise revenues, focused on early and mid-stage customer acquisition and team building. With momentum and a repeatable sales process in place, she would hand the reins to an operational vice president.   
  
Prior to her entrepreneurial roles, Brodt held the position of director of enterprise sales & marketing for PointCast where she was responsible for building and managing a team of sales, marketing and technical professionals chartered to drive viewership of the PointCast Network in large enterprises. Prior to PointCast, Pam spent seven years in sales and sales management roles at Claris and Apple Computer focused on driving channel revenues.  
  
Brodt holds a B.A in Mass Communications from the University of Denver.  
  
“With the impending GA release of Open Cloud System 2.0, the time is right for someone of Pam’s caliber and experience to come on board,” said Michael Grant, CEO. “More and more, enterprise CIOs and infrastructure VPs are feeling the urgency and need to deploy a private cloud solution that delivers the same benefits and approach of public cloud systems such as Amazon Web Services, and Pam’s joining our team will help those customers see that Open Cloud System is the reliable and production-grade option for doing that.”  
  
“Enterprise CIOs are wary of trying to build, deploy and manage a custom-developed infrastructure based on raw OpenStack technology,” said Brodt. “Savvy IT leaders want to reduce their risk, focus on delivering services to their customers and take advantage of a successful product-based solution where they’re supported by pros who’ve built elastic cloud infrastructure for companies like theirs. Cloudscaling has the product and the expertise to deliver, and they’ve done it successfully time after time. I’m excited to join the team and ramp up our sales organization.”
