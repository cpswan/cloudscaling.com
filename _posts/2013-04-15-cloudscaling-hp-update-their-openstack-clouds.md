# Cloudscaling, HP update their OpenStack clouds

On Monday, Cloudscaling said it’s teaming up with [Juniper Networks](http://gigaom.com/2013/04/12/scoop-juniper-ericsson-go-for-openstack-gold/) and will use that company’s Virtual Network Control to enable a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) feature that maps to VPCs in Amazon’s public cloud.
