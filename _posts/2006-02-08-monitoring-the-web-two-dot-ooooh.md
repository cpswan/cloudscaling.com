# Monitoring the Web-Two-Dot-Ooooh …

There has been a virtual onslaught of 'Web 2.0' companies recently. Perhaps your business is in this category, perhaps not, but I've found there are a couple of key places to watch for the latest. I recommend starting with [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/), which is a fantastic blog by Michael Arrington on Web 2.0 startups. It is regularly updated and Michael is succinct and well-written. Be sure to catch his [latest entry](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/07/a-taste-of-demo-2006/) on [Demo 2006](http://www.demo.com/conf/index.html). While TechCrunch is almost exclusively focused on Web 2.0 startups, we also highly recommend [Om Malik](http://www.gigaom.com/) who more generally covers technology, particularly as it applies to broadband. [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/), being the Web 2.0 poster child, also has a terrific [blog](http://www.37signals.com/svn/).Â  And if you haven't yet discovered how [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) can be useful, try checking out the links available for the popular tags '[web2.0](http://del.icio.us/popular/web2.0)' and '[web20](http://del.icio.us/popular/web20)' for more interesting resources. Not sure if you're 'Web 2.0?' I prefer Paul Graham's [insight](http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html) into what that means, but you also have the choice of Tim O'Reilly's [definition](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html). If that doesn't clarify it for you, just use the [validator](http://web2.0validator.com/). ;)
