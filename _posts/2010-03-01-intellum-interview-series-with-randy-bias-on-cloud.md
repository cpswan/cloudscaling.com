# Intellum Interview Series with Randy Bias on Cloud

I recently did a very long podcast and interview with Chip Ramsey, CEO of [Intellum](http://www.intellum.com/working.html), on cloud computing.  Intellum is an up and comer in the e-learning space and are doing a new series of interviews with thought leaders in different spaces.  They started with [Karl Kapp on e-learning](http://karlkapp.blogspot.com/2010/01/discussion-with-chip-ramsey-ceo-of.html) and I'm honored that they tapped me to discuss cloud computing. There is a lot of great cloud information in here that I don't get a chance to talk about in venues where time is short like panels or blog entries.  Definitely recommended listening, but it's a long interview so it might be easier to consume in small chunks.  To make this a bit easier for you, I've chopped it into five smaller and more consumable MP3s (below) OR go directly to the [Intellum page](http://www.intellum.com/working.html#tab3) to listen. 

  * Part 1. [Introduction](http://d2xyq36i1ecdst.cloudfront.net/podcasts/Chip_Ramsey_Intellum_Interview_Randy_Bias_Cloud_Computing_Pt1_Introduction.mp3) (6:35)
  * Part 2. [Cloud Computing Defined](http://d2xyq36i1ecdst.cloudfront.net/podcasts/Chip_Ramsey_Intellum_Interview_Randy_Bias_Cloud_Computing_Pt2_Cloud_Computing_Defined.mp3) (13:11)
  * Part 3. [Leveraging the Cloud for Startups, SMBs, and Enterprise](http://d2xyq36i1ecdst.cloudfront.net/podcasts/Chip_Ramsey_Intellum_Interview_Randy_Bias_Cloud_Computing_Pt3_Leveraging_the_Cloud_for_Startups_SMBs_and_Enterprise.mp3) (14:54)
  * Part 4. [Fears and Concerns](http://d2xyq36i1ecdst.cloudfront.net/podcasts/Chip_Ramsey_Intellum_Interview_Randy_Bias_Cloud_Computing_Pt4_Fears_and_Concerns.mp3) (13:09)
  * Part 5. [Future of Cloud in 2010 and Beyond](http://d2xyq36i1ecdst.cloudfront.net/podcasts/Chip_Ramsey_Intellum_Interview_Randy_Bias_Cloud_Computing_Pt5_Future_of_Cloud_in_2010_and_Beyond.mp3) (7:13)
During this interview series I also refer to four layers in cloud.  Most folks like to talk about infrastructure (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), platforms (Platform-as-a-Service), and applications (Software-as-a-Service).  There is a fourth layer that rides on top that I haven't had a chance to blog on yet, but Part 2 goes into some detail.  To make it a little more clear what I mean, see the diagram below. ![Cloud Stack]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/02/cloud-stack-small.jpg)
