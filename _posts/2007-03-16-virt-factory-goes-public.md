# virt-factory goes public

Yesterday, [virt-factory](http://virt-factory.et.redhat.com/), an internal [RedHat](http://www.redhat.com) project, went public. It is a framework for deploying and managing virtual appliances in a datacenter environment. It's great to see things heading this direction, one we feel is imminent. This project is brought to you by [David Lutterkort](http://watzmann.net/blog/) who works in RedHat's emerging technologies group and is also a principle contributor to [Puppet](http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/PuppetIntroduction), a next generation system configuration system that we are interested in.
