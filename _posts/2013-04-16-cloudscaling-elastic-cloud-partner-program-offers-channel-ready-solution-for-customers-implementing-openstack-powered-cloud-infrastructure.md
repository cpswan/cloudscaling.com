# Cloudscaling Elastic Cloud Partner Program Offers Channel-Ready Solution for Customers Implementing OpenStack-Powered Cloud Infrastructure

**PORTLAND, Ore. — April 16, 2013 —** Cloudscaling, the elastic cloud company, has launched the Elastic Cloud Partner Program to provide its ecosystem of IHVs, ISVs, System Integrators, VARs and consultants with the tools and resources to bring Open Cloud System to their enterprise customers.

The mission of the Elastic Cloud Partner Program is to help Cloudscaling partners become trusted advisors to their clients in the delivery of the most advanced elastic cloud infrastructure solutions built on Open Cloud System. Current partners include ActiveState, Arista Networks, Avnet, CloudTP, CumuLogic, Enstratius, Juniper Networks, Redapt, Quanta QCT and Seagate.

“We created the Elastic Cloud Partner Program in response to enterprises telling us that they need a complete OpenStack solution including a robust set of third-party products to address enterprise requirements,” said Andy Green, vice president, business and channel development of Cloudscaling. “With new features in version 2.5, Open Cloud System is the most mature, channel-ready OpenStack offering available. The Elastic Cloud Partner Program lets Cloudscaling customers choose the certified hardware, software and delivery partners to address their specific requirements.”

Cloudscaling was among the first commercial entities to[ publicly support OpenStack](http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) and a growing list of customers in production deployments. It was the first company to deploy a Nova compute public cloud and the first to deploy a Swift storage public cloud outside of Rackspace. The company is a founding member of the OpenStack Foundation and a charter Gold Corporate Sponsor. Co-founder and CTO Randy Bias has served on the Foundation board since its inception, and Cloudscaling is a top code contributor to the project.

Participants in the program receive technical and engineering support from Cloudscaling experts, access to products for testing in the company’s dedicated test environments, integration support for platform services, and coordination with other partners to create new features and capabilities. Partners also have access to the Cloudscaling team for product support, sales support and deployment best practices.

Companies interested in participating in the Elastic Cloud Partner Program should contact Andy Green via the [Cloudscaling website](http://www.cloudscaling.com/contact/).
