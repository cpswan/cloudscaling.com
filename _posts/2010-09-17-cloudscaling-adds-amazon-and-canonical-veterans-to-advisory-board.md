# Cloudscaling Adds Amazon and Canonical Veterans to Advisory Board

Group's Experience to Help Telecoms Build Profitable Cloud Offerings

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17 /PRNewswire/ -- Three cloud computing experts with technical and product leadership experience at Amazon.com's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Internap, Canonical and the Leading Edge Forum at Computer Sciences Corporation (LEF-CSC) have joined Cloudscaling's Board of Advisors.

Each of the three brings experience in a different aspect of Cloudscaling's strategy: make telco and service provider cloud deployments competitive through automated architectures built on commodity hardware and open source software. This reduces risk, shortens development schedules and increases ROI of cloud deployments when compared to legacy IT architectures, which rely upon expensive infrastructure and low admin-to-server ratios.

Simon Wardley was responsible for cloud computing strategy at Canonical and is a recognized expert on cloud and utility computing and open source software. During his time there, Canonical's Linux distribution -- Ubuntu -- became one of the leading cloud computing operating systems. Wardley now researches at LEF-CSC on the impact of technology change on organizational structure with emphasis on cloud computing, enterprise 2.0 and commoditization.

Chris Brown was a founding member, architect and lead developer for EC2. After Amazon, he worked on the design and construction of another massive web infrastructure as director of engineering for Microsoft's Edge Computing Network (ECN). Brown is presently vice president of engineering at Opscode, which produces the configuration management framework Cloudscaling uses to build highly scaled automated solutions.

Ben Black's experience building and operating scalable systems architecture include leadership positions at Amazon.com, Microsoft ECN and Opscode. Black is a recognized expert in internet scale networks and was a member of the Internap R&D; team that produced three patents in routing and traffic optimization. He is a co-founder of fast_ip.

The three join Bill Lanfri, who offers more than 25 years of experience in enterprise networking and telecommunications. He previously served as operating partner at Accel Partners, CEO of Big Bear Network, and CEO of Avanex. He was a founding investor and advisor to RedBack Networks. Lanfri also has served as an investor in an advisor to Network Alchemy. He was a member of the leadership team at SynOptics.

"These four individuals comprise a vast collection of experience designing and building clouds for the biggest and most successful players," said Randy Bias, CEO and founder of Cloudscaling. "Their guidance puts us in a strong position to help our telecommunications clients capture the massive market opportunity. With Cloudscaling, they can build competitive clouds more quickly and with less risk."

Cloudscaling helps telcos and service providers bring Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds to market. The Cloudscaling team draws on experience building and managing infrastructure at companies such as Amazon, GoGrid, Yahoo, Engine Yard, and Puppet Labs.
