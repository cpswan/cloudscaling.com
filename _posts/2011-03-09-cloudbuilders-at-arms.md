Cloudbuilders will accelerate OpenStack's transition from a collection of code repositories with an ecosystem of developers to an ecosystem of organizations providing services. Organizations will no longer be left to their own devices, literally and figuratively. This transition to more code running on real hardware providing production services will help to focus the OpenStack community on the real challenges we are all facing.
