# CloudScale Networks

Apologies for the radio silence. We have been rapidly evolving the Virtual Server Room product over the past several months. The result has been the decision to morph into a service that leverages [Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011) and to roll that service into a new company and organization, [CloudScale Networks](http://www.cloudscale.net). You can find out more at the CloudScale website. In the meantime, neoTactics will continue as an IT-focused consultancy.
