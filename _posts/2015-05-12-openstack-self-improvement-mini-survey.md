# OpenStack Self-Improvement Mini-Survey

Want to help make OpenStack great?  I've put together a very quick survey to get some deeper feedback than is provided by the User Survey.  The intention is to provide some additional information around the State of the Stack v4 I'm giving next week at the summit.

I will really appreciate it if you take the 2-3 minutes out of your day to answer this honestly.

**UPDATE**: Horizon was missing from the survey and I have added it.  Heartfelt apologies to all of the Horizon committers.  An honest mistake on my part.  OpenStack is almost too big to keep track of.  :)
