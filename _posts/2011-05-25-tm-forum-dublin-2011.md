# Web-Scale is the Cloud Opportunity for Carriers

Co-Founder and CTO Randy Bias is in Dublin telling the world's largest telcos that web-scale cloud is the only way to be successful in the cloud Carriers have a huge opportunity in the cloud, but only if they embrace the disruption of web-scale cloud and adopt a two-cloud strategy in the short term. This is the message Randy Bias is delivering at TM Forum [Management World](http://www.tmforum.org/ManagementWorld2011/9414/home.html) in Dublin today. He's keynoting in the [Cloud Services Summit](http://www.tmforum.org/ConferenceAgenda/10131/home.html?ModuleClass=10135) (scroll: "Cloud Provider Business Models for Telcos") alongside Cloudscaling client Charles Huh of KT. Both are making the case for telcos to include web-scale cloud in their service portfolios: 

_The "Legacy" architecture that many telcos call cloud is not really cloud. It's automated and virtualized legacy IT. To be successful, you must also build and deploy web-scale cloud in the model proven by Amazon Web Services and other cloud pioneers. To capture the huge total addressable market available in mobile, web apps, and emerging markets, web-scale cloud is the only path forward._

Randy made this case in an [article](http://www.tmforum.org/EmbracingtheCloud/10760/home.html) published earlier this month in the May edition of TM Forum's _Inside Leadership_ magazine, where he maps out how web-scale cloud meets the textbook definition of a disruptive technology. The good news for carriers is that implementing a two-cloud strategy is a low risk move. Their experiences with "legacy cloud" deployments have made them see high development and operational costs and long development cycles as the norm for cloud. With web-scale cloud, they'll find a TCO that is shown to be 3-5x lower than the virtualized and automated legacy IT they've been calling "cloud." Thus, web-scale cloud will deliver much more favorable cost and deployment metrics than they've been trained to expect. _Disrupt. Don't be disrupted._ _ _

**[Sankar Nagarajan](#3063 "2011-07-17 07:59:00"):** Interesting, there is definitely the web scale to be leveraged by Carriers. Equally there is a "Super computing Scale" to be fully leveraged by Lifesciences and Engineering companies in the days to come.Â  http://cloudshoring.wordpress.com
