# RightScale announces RightGrid

Very cool, one of [our](http://www.cloudscale.net/) competitors, [RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com), launched their new product, [RightGrid](http://info.rightscale.com/2007/7/12/rightgrid-intro). It's an interesting solution they are advocating, although it doesn't feel much different from a standard batch processing system. But if you are looking for this kind of solution, I would strongly suggest you check them out. Our own objectives are a [bit larger in scope](http://www.cloudscale.net/service). You may have noticed that the volume on this blog has picked up. Expect quite a few more postings in the next month or two. I'm committed to bring some of our perspective out from behind closed doors and into the blogosphere.
