# Can You Trust Cloud Computing?

A [thoughtful blog posting](http://www.subtraction.com/2008/10/15/a-cloud-and-a-prayer) from Khoi Vinh asks whether we can trust clouds given the current financial climate. It's good to be cautious about trusting all of your data to 'the cloud', but you **should** already be evaluating your cloud providers based on their ability to give you a backup option. Most providers already have such mechanisms. Regardless of the state of the economy this is **always** a risk and being prudent and careful about the cloud services you pick is a requirement for any business owner or IT decision maker. Trust, but verify (and backup).
