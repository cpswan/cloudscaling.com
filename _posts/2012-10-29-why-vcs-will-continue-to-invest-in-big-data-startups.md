# Why VCs will continue to invest in big data startups

Bias [wrote a post](http://www.cloudave.com/22929/a-response-to-geoffrey-moore-manifest-disruption/) that more broadly reflects what these ... startups represent.  The market is going through a deep disruption. It’s a model 'pioneered by the most massive Internet players (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter).  This IT model starts with datacenters built with extreme power efficiencies ([PUEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness) reaching 1.2 or less), extends to open hardware projects (like [Open Compute](http://opencompute.org/)), and reaches into the transformation to a scale-out software architecture model (epitomized by “big data” projects like Hadoop and Cassandra).'
