# Cloudscaling To Support Docker For OCS Application Workloads

Open Cloud System (OCS) + Docker Provide the Portability and Infrastructure required for Next Gen Applications

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA May 13, 2014** â€“ Cloudscaling, the trusted leader in OpenStack-powered IaaS for private and hybrid clouds, today announced its support for Docker, an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run anywhere. When combined, users have the best of both worlds: low cost elastic cloud infrastructure and a scale-out application portability framework.

Cloudscaling's Docker support will come in two successive phases. Beginning immediately, Cloudscaling will support customers using Docker as an application encapsulation mechanism running on top of its core product Open Cloud System (OCS). Consumers of OCS will be able to deliver arbitrary application stacks on-demand to any OCS installation via Docker containers, enabling provisioning of developer-centric solutions in milliseconds. This will allow customers to use Docker as a primary means for application deployment, management, and scaling with confidence. 

Going forward, Cloudscaling will collaborate with Docker on a plan for future support of Docker as a core OCS service. This would effectively provide bare metal instances as an option for customers who have workloads that do not want to pay the virtualization performance penalty. Examples of this include scale-out web applications, workloads typically in need of bare metal and custom hardware and big data workloads such as Hadoop.

Docker technologies offer both powerful developer capabilities and a lightweight application packaging for enterprise workloads across industries. The project's popularity reflects the IT industry's growing recognition of the importance of standardized, open source, container-based application deployment across public, private and hybrid cloud infrastructures. "We have always seen cloud computing as a means to end," said Randy Bias, CEO of Cloudscaling. "Server consolidation and virtualization were only a minor beachhead. The real value in cloud is delivering a nimble, more agile infrastructure for next generation applications. The combination of OCS public cloud interoperability and Docker's approach to containerization eliminates the normal worries about cost, performance and portability issues associated with a virtual machine."

"We are big OpenStack proponents, and have seen considerable demand for production-grade solutions to run OpenStack with Docker," said Ben Golub, Docker CEO. "We were very pleased to hear of CloudScaling's plans to integrate Docker with Open Cloud System, and look forward to seeing the results of this exciting initiative."

**About Cloudscaling** Cloudscaling is the trusted leader in OpenStack-powered IaaS for private and hybrid clouds. Our core product, Open Cloud System (OCS), is the most advanced OpenStack-powered cloud infrastructure software available. OCS is designed to meet the requirements of next generation cloud-based applications, delivering the agility, performance, and economic benefits of leading public cloud providers, but deployable in the customer's data center and under IT's control.
