# Why Customers Want Elastic Clouds With Agile Networking

![Azmir and Jenifer still for post](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Azmir-and-Jenifer-still-for-post-300x199.png)In April of this year, Cloudscaling [announced a partnership](/blog/press-releases/juniper/) with Juniper Networks to integrate Juniper’s Junos V Contrail virtual network control (VNC) technology into Cloudscaling’s [Open Cloud System](http://cloudscaling.com/products/ocs-system-overview/) (OCS).

Juniper and Cloudscaling chose each other because:

  1. Both understand the scale and architecture issues when transitioning IT to a large-scale, self-service model.
  2. Both have the technical and services backgrounds capabilities to serve Enterprise, SaaS and Service Providers.
  3. We share a common vision of  delivering cutting-edge, production-grade cloud solutions leveraging proven technology.
  4. We both are heavily invested in OpenStack.

Both teams understand what’s driving buyers to demand solutions that scale IP services wrapped in a turnkey, open, elastic cloud infrastructure solution that also interoperates with their existing data centers and elastic public cloud environments like Amazon Web Services.

By embedding Junos V Contrail technology into OCS we are jointly able to solve many of the design compromises present in other private cloud solutions. Our joint solution delivers dynamic scaling capabilities that app developers expect of a Layer-3 network – IP reachability and network services including advanced security, horizontal scaling, and fault tolerance.

I spent a few minutes with Jennifer Lin, Senior Director – Product Management for Juniper at GigaOm Structure a couple of weeks ago talking about why the Juniper/Cloudscaling partnership is useful for enterprise buyers of elastic cloud infrastructure software.
