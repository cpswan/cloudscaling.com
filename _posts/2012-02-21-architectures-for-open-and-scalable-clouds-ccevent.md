# Architectures for open and scalable clouds #ccevent

Below is the presentation I gave at this year's 2012 [Cloud Connect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/) in Santa Clara.  It was extremely well received.  Better than I expected really, given it's last minute nature.  For some, I think a lot of the architectural and design patterns aren't new, but perhaps they haven't been portrayed in quite this way before.  For others, a lot of these ideas and content _are_ new. Regardless, I got some [props](https://twitter.com/#!/adrianco/status/170330635163013120) from Adrian Cockcroft, one of the primary cloud architects for Netflix.  I think very highly of Netflix approach to re-architecting their application to be 'cloud-ready' and to achieve high levels of uptime on AWS EC2.  If Adrian thinks this is right on, then it must be. Enjoy.
