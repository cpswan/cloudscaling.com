# Scalable Web Site Resources

In doing some research for a new GoGrid whitepaper I needed a list of references and resources for folks to get more information on building scalable web applications and infrastructure.  Reached out to my twitter network and got a lot of great responses.  Thought I should share.  Here's the list: 

  * [The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources by John Allspaw](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Capacity-Planning-Scaling-Resources/dp/0596518579)
  * [Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle](http://www.amazon.com/Scalable-Internet-Architectures-Developers-Library/dp/067232699X)
  * [Building Scalable Web Sites by Cal Henderson](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-applications/dp/0596102356/ref=pd_sim_dbs_b_5)
  * [High Performance Web Sites by Steve Souders](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309/ref=pd_sim_dbs_b_3)
  * [Release It! by Michael Nygard](http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213)
  * [High Performance MySQL by Jeremy Zawodny and Derek Balling](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Jeremy-Zawodny/dp/0596003064)
  * [Cloud Application Architectures by George Reese](http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Application-Architectures-Applications-Infrastructure/dp/0596156367)
Hope this is useful for you and I welcome additions!
