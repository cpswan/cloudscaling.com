# Three Lessons from AWS Rolling Reboots

Three takeaways from the AWS rolling reboot of EC2 instances: 

  1. Architecting apps to be cloud-ready is key
  2. Architecting massive-scale clouds to handle massive-scale updates is critical to a successful security strategy; see #1
  3. AWS again shows that the web scale cloud model has distinct advantages over enterprise clouds running legacy enterprise apps that can't support rapid cycling of many VMs in a short period of time
