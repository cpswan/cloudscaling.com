# Cloudscaling Webinar Series: 4 new installments

In the modern world of IT the need for scalability and agility is undeniable. Cloud computing with OpenStack is a powerful way of providing and consuming IaaS to achieve scale and agility, but its very nature as an open source project raises IT management challenges. Removing some of the implementation complexity and management obstacles from the OpenStack equation is vital to enterprise adoption.

For enterprises to confidently migrate - as a matter of course - to OpenStack-powered IaaS, six requirements must be met. 1) High Availability, 2) Robust Management, 3) Open Architecture, 4) Scalable and Extensible, 5) Hybrid Cloud Federation, 6) Global Support and Services

The Cloudscaling webinar series will shine the light on the essential technical and business components required for organizations to confidently adopt enterprise-grade OpenStack powered clouds. Each webinar will include a live Q&A with the individuals at the center of the OpenStack movement. This four-part webinar series is now open for registration.
