# Overcast Interviews GoGrid

Great new cloud computing podcast, [Overcast](http://overcast.typepad.com), interviews myself and [Michael Sheehan](http://blog.techdad.net/).  In this latest episode, #6, we cover [cloudcenters](http://blog.gogrid.com/2009/01/08/cloudcenters-are-datacenters-in-the-sky/) in detail.  Lots of good talk about why standards matter if done right.  I really enjoyed it, although I think there are a couple of editing errors in the beginning.  I don't repeat myself that much in real life.  :) You can find the podcast on the [Overcast blog](http://overcast.typepad.com/overcast/2009/02/overcast-show-6-feb-5-2009-with-randy-bias-and-michael-sheehan-gogrid.html).  Also recommend Geva Perry's related blog article, [Beware of Premature Elaboration](http://gevaperry.typepad.com/main/2009/02/beware-of-premature-elaboration-of-cloud-standards.html).
