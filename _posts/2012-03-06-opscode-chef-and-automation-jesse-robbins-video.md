# Opscode, Chef and Automation: Jesse Robbins Video

Reposting is not something we do often, but this was too good to pass up. Jesse Robbins of Opscode gave an exceptional 20-minute keynote at [Cloud Connect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/santaclara/) last month. Check out [the video of his keynote on the Opscode blog](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/02/14/automate-all-the-things/). Also, the short video embedded below is a good summary about Opscode Chef and cloud infrastructure automation. http://blip.tv/play/AYLa3FcC.html?p=1   Finally, be sure to check out [#ChefConf](http://chefconf.opscode.com/) May 15-17 in San Francisco.
