# Private: SaaS is Odd Man Out?

[Here](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/working_the_clouds.php) is a review of a panel at the recent [Structure '08](http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/) conference by Lidjia Davis. It's a quick synopsis followed by a so-called 'Cloud Computing Primer' with a particularly questionable assertion: 

> However, the general consensus is that cloud computing has become an umbrella term covering various solutions. 

If there was a general consensus on anything it was that _cloud computing isn't well defined yet_. In fact, the definition problem was a running joke at most of the events, including Structure '08, that I went to this week. I'm still not happy that we're trying to turn cloud into aaS, but I'll happily give up that particular battle if I can get people to stop lumping SaaS under 'cloud computing' (I can hear the teeth gnashing at various SaaS vendors as I write this).  **The Odd Man** Look at the three categories that Lidjia says compose cloud computing: 

  * **SaaS:** subscription-based, application, end-user focused, includes Gmail and Salesforce.com
  * **IaaS:** pay-by-the-drink, computing services, developer-focused, includes Amazon's EC2, [GoGrid](http://www.gogrid.com), [FlexiScale](http://www.flexiscale.com), and others
**PaaS:** pay-by-the-drink, application hosting, developer-focused, includes Google App Engine, [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), and others
Which of these does not look like the other? You guessed it. SaaS. SaaS is **not** cloud computing services and it never will be. No matter how hard you squint. The pricing models are different, the target market is different, and the application of the technology is different. PaaS and IaaS are very very similar on all of these fronts. **The Meaning of Words** 'Cloud computing' needs to mean something or it's worthless as a term. It can't just mean 'anything running on the Internet'. That's just a network service. We've had those. That's where the 'service' in 'as-a-Service' comes from. So, if it means something new and something specific, then it doesn't mean SaaS. Sure, you can use cloud computing (PaaS or IaaS) to build SaaS and deliver it. But that doesn't make SaaS a cloud service because it rides on top of cloud services. That's like saying an application is a server because it runs on one. Different parts of any 'stack' are, by definition, independent. PaaS and IaaS are clearly lower bits of the stack. You can argue about how similar or different the two are, but clearly SaaS isn't part of the picture. Call it IaaS, PaaS, 'cloud services', 'cloud computing', but it's still about infrastructure being using by developers and operators in an on-demand fashion and **not** about [updating your sales contacts](http://www.salesforce.com) or [managing your customer's projects.](http://www.basecamphq.com/) **Summary** Still, the jury is out on where we wind up. It's still early and logic doesn't win marketing battles. If it did, the term 'hacker' would never have been [hijacked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28computing%29#Controversy_and_ambiguity). As a parting aside, I'm intensely curious what GigaOM's team is saying about the definitions in their [new cloud computing briefing](http://briefings.gigaom.com/). Curiosity might wind up winning out over guarding my wallet. Unless some kind soul out there has a copy I could borrow?
