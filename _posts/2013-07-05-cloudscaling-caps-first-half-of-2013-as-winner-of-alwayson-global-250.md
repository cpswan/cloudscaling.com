# Cloudscaling Caps First Half of 2013 as Winner of AlwaysOn Global 250

Earlier this week, Cloudscaling was [named as a winner](http://aonetwork.com/Announcing-the-2013-AlwaysOn-Global-250-Top-Private-Companies/) of an award given to companies with “game-changing approaches and technologies that are likely to disrupt existing markets and entrenched players in the Global Silicon Valley.”

![AO.SVIS13.Global250](http://www.cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AO.SVIS13.Global250-207x300.jpg)Selection for the award marks the midpoint of what’s already been a big year for Cloudscaling. Sales of private and hybrid cloud systems software to major reference customers are growing. Names like online gaming company [Ubisoft](/blog/press-releases/ubisoft-chooses-cloudscaling-open-cloud-system/), daily deal site [Living Social](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/livingsocial-chooses-open-cloud-system/), storage service EVault and others highlight the growth of our product, Open Cloud System (OCS), in production deployments.

Strategic partnerships with [Juniper Networks](/blog/press-releases/juniper/) and [Seagate](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-and-seagate-partner-to-deliver-elastic-cloud-infrastructure-based-on-openstack-technology/), and a successful [Series B funding](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-closes-10-million-series-b-funding/) demonstrate the company’s positive momentum. We’ve announced [general availability of OCS 2.0](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/cloudscaling-ships-open-cloud-system-v-2-0/), and we’ve unveiled plans for [OCS 2.5](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/press-releases/ocs25/), which will include a range of new features. And, we're recognized as a [top-10 code contributor](http://bitergia.com/public/reports/openstack/2013_04_grizzly/) to the OpenStack project that [we've publicly supported](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/does-openstack-change-the-cloud-game/) since its launch July 2010.  

Cloudscaling was selected by the AlwaysOn editorial team and industry experts based on a set of five criteria during a three-month selection process:

  * innovation
  * market potential
  * commercialization
  * stakeholder value
  * media buzz

The AlwaysOn Global 250 winners were selected from a group of domestic and international technology companies nominated by investors, bankers, journalists and industry thought leaders.
