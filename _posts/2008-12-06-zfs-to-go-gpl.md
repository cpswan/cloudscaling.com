# ZFS to go GPL?

Word on the street is that Sun is exploring the option of going GPL at the [CEO](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/) level. They have been chatting with customer council(s) about whether they should do this. The answer is simple: _Do it. Do it now._ ZFS has inspired many. There are a number of up and coming new filesystem and large scale storage solutions being developed under the GPL like [Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs), [Tux3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux3), and [Ceph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph) that all have similar characteristics to ZFS. If you don't GPL it now, you'll lose the opportunity to make the kind of difference you are trying to make.
