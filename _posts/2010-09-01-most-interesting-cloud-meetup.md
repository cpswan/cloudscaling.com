# A Most Interesting Cloud Meetup

![most_interesting]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/2010/09/most_interesting.jpg) Relax after VMWorld and come share Dos Equis with the OpenStackers. We'll be discussing cloud, cloud, cloud and maybe dodgeball Thursday evening. 5PM-8PM Sept. 2nd @ Tres Agaves Restaurant 130 Townsend Street San Francisco, CA 94107 (Just a few blocks from Moscone) Come out and meet people working on OpenStack. (We're interesting people and willing to talk about things besides cloud. Promise...)
